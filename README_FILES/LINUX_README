LINUX PORTABILITY
=================

On RedHat Linux 7.0 you must install the db3-devel RPM before you
can compile the Postfix source code.

On RedHat Linux 7.1 procmail no longer has permission to write the
mail spool directory. Workaround: chmod 1777 /var/spool/mail.

LINUX SYSLOGD PERFORMANCE
=========================

LINUX syslogd uses synchronous writes by default. Because of this,
syslogd can actually use more system resources than Postfix.  To
avoid such madness, disable synchronous mail logfile writes by
editing /etc/syslog.conf and by prepending a - to the logfile name:

    mail.*                          -/var/log/mail.log

Send a "kill -HUP" to the syslogd to make the change effective.
