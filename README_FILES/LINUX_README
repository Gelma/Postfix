On RedHat Linux 7.0 you must install the db3-devel RPM before you can compile
the Postfix source code.

Warning: do not use multiple Berkeley DB versions. Every Postfix program will
dump core when it is built with a different Berkeley DB version than the
version that is used by the system library routines. See the DB_README file for
further information.

On RedHat Linux 7.1 pprrooccmmaaiill no longer has permission to write the mail spool
directory. Workaround: chmod 1777 /var/spool/mail.

LINUX ssyyssllooggdd uses synchronous writes by default. Because of this, ssyyssllooggdd can
actually use more system resources than Postfix. To avoid such badness, disable
synchronous mail logfile writes by editing /etc/syslog.conf and by prepending a
- to the logfile name:

    /etc/syslog.conf:
        mail.*                          -/var/log/mail.log

Send a "kkiillll --HHUUPP" to the ssyyssllooggdd to make the change effective.
