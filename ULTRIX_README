I've upgraded the MTA of our DECstation-3100 running Ultrix4.3a to
postfix-19990317-pl05 and am sending you the patches I needed to get
it running under Ultrix.

 ...

 o One of the bugs of Ultrix's /bin/sh is that shell-variables set in
   arguments of `:' expand to garbage if expanded in here-documents.
   Using a different shell helps.  I needed to replace all calls of
   ``sh .../makedefs'' by ``$(SHELL) .../makedefs'' in all the
   Makefile.in and am now able to use 

	make SHELL=/bin/sh5 or zsh.

 ...

 o Ultrix's FD_SET_SIZE is 4096, but getdtablesize() returns 64 by
   default, if not increased when building a new kernel.  getrlimit()
   doesn't know RLIMIT_NOFILE.  This makes event_init() always log
   the warning: `could allocate space for only 64 open files'.

   I just reduced the threshold from 256 to 64, but this is not good.
   The initial problem still remains: How to disable this warning on
   Ultrix without making the source ugly?  

[I have updated util/sys_defs.h, and by default set FD_SETSIZE to
100.  This should be sufficient for a workstation. No-one would
run a major mail hub on Ultrix 4. -- Wietse]
