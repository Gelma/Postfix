\fIcommand\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
This command is reserved for the super-user. To submit mail,
use the Postfix \fBsendmail\fR command.

The \fBpostfix\fR command controls the operation of the Postfix
mail system: start or stop the \fBmaster\fR daemon, do a health
check, and other maintenance.

The \fBpostfix\fR command sets up a standardized environment and
runs the \fBpostfix-script\fR shell script to do the actual work.

The following commands are implemented:
.IP \fBcheck\fR
Validate the Postfix mail system configuration. Warn about bad
directory/file ownership or permissions, and create missing
directories.
.IP \fBstart\fR
Start the Postfix mail system. This also runs the configuration
check described above.
.IP \fBstop\fR
Stop the Postfix mail system in an orderly fashion. Running processes
are allowed to terminate at their earliest convenience.
.sp
Note: in order to refresh the Postfix mail system after a
configuration change, do not use the \fBstart\fR and \fBstop\fR
commands in succession. Use the \fBreload\fR command instead.
.IP \fBabort\fR
Stop the Postfix mail system abruptly. Running processes are
signaled to stop immediately.
.IP \fBflush\fR
Force delivery: attempt to deliver every message in the deferred
mail queue. Normally, attempts to deliver delayed mail happen at
regular intervals, the interval doubling after each failed attempt.
.IP \fBreload\fR
Re-read configuration files. Running processes terminate at their
earliest convenience.
.PP
The following options are implemented:
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
Read the \fBmain.cf\fR and \fBmaster.cf\fR configuration files in
the named directory instead of the default configuration directory.
Use this to distinguish between multiple Postfix instances on the
same host.
.IP "\fB-D\fR (with \fBpostfix start\fR only)"
Run each Postfix daemon under control of a debugger as specified
via the \fBdebugger_command\fR configuration parameter.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.
