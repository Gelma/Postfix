.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBqmqp-sink\fR listens on the named host (or address) and port.
It receives messages from the network and throws them away.
The purpose is to measure QMQP client performance, not protocol
compliance.
Connections can be accepted on IPV4 endpoints or UNIX-domain sockets.
IPV4 is the default.
This program is the complement of the \fBqmqp-source\fR(1) program.
.IP \fB-c\fR
Display a running counter that is updated whenever a delivery
is completed.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Increase verbosity. Specify \fB-v -v\fR to see some of the QMQP
conversation.
.IP "\fB-x \fItime\fR
Terminate after \fItime\fR seconds. This is to facilitate memory
leak testing.
