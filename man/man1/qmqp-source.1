.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
qmqp-source connects to the named host and TCP port (default 628)
and sends one or more messages to it, either sequentially
or in parallel. The program speaks the QMQP protocol.
Connections can be made to UNIX-domain and IPV4 servers.
IPV4 is the default.

Options:
.IP -c
Display a running counter that is incremented each time
a delivery completes.
.IP "-C count"
When a host sends RESET instead of SYN|ACK, try \fIcount\fR times
before giving up. The default count is 1. Specify a larger count in
order to work around a problem with TCP/IP stacks that send RESET
when the listen queue is full.
.IP "-f from"
Use the specified sender address (default: <foo@myhostname>).
.IP "-l length"
Send \fIlength\fR bytes as message payload. The length
includes the message headers.
.IP "-m message_count"
Send the specified number of messages (default: 1).
.IP "-r recipient_count"
Send the specified number of recipients per transaction (default: 1).
Recipient names are generated by prepending a number to the
recipient address.
.IP "-s session_count"
Run the specified number of QMQP sessions in parallel (default: 1).
.IP "-t to"
Use the specified recipient address (default: <foo@myhostname>).
.IP "-R interval"
Wait for a random period of time 0 <= n <= interval between messages.
Suspending one thread does not affect other delivery threads.
.IP "-w interval"
Wait a fixed time between messages.
Suspending one thread does not affect other delivery threads.
