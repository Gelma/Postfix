.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBsendmail\fR program implements the Postfix to Sendmail
compatibility interface.
For the sake of compatibility with existing applications, some
Sendmail command-line options are recognized but silently ignored.

By default, \fBsendmail\fR reads a message from standard input
until EOF or until it reads a line with only a \fB.\fR character,
and arranges for delivery.  \fBsendmail\fR relies on the
\fBpostdrop\fR(1) command to create a queue file in the \fBmaildrop\fR
directory.

Specific command aliases are provided for other common modes of
operation:
.IP \fBmailq\fR
List the mail queue. Each entry shows the queue file ID, message
size, arrival time, sender, and the recipients that still need to
be delivered.  If mail could not be delivered upon the last attempt,
the reason for failure is shown. This mode of operation is implemented
by executing the \fBpostqueue\fR(1) command.
.IP \fBnewaliases\fR
Initialize the alias database.  If no input file is specified (with
the \fB-oA\fR option, see below), the program processes the file(s)
specified with the \fBalias_database\fR configuration parameter.
If no alias database type is specified, the program uses the type
specified with the \fBdatabase_type\fR configuration parameter.
This mode of operation is implemented by running the \fBpostalias\fR(1)
command.
.sp
Note: it may take a minute or so before an alias database update
becomes visible. Use the \fBpostfix reload\fR command to eliminate
this delay.
.PP
These and other features can be selected by specifying the
appropriate combination of command-line options. Some features are
controlled by parameters in the \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file.

The following options are recognized:
.IP "\fB-B \fIbody_type\fR (ignored)"
The message body MIME type. Currently, Postfix implements
\fBjust-send-eight\fR.
.IP "\fB-C \fIconfig_file\fR (ignored :-)"
The path name of the \fBsendmail.cf\fR file. Postfix configuration
files are kept in \fB/etc/postfix\fR.
.IP "\fB-F \fIfull_name\fR
Set the sender full name. This is used only with messages that
have no \fBFrom:\fR message header.
.IP "\fB-G\fR (ignored)"
Gateway (relay) submission, as opposed to initial user submission.
.IP \fB-I\fR
Initialize alias database. See the \fBnewaliases\fR
command above.
.IP "\fB-L \fIlabel\fR (ignored)"
The logging label. Use the \fBsyslog_name\fR configuration
parameter instead.
.IP "\fB-N \fIdsn\fR (ignored)"
Delivery status notification control. Currently, Postfix does
not implement \fBDSN\fR.
.IP "\fB-R \fIreturn_limit\fR (ignored)"
Limit the size of bounced mail. Use the \fBbounce_size_limit\fR
configuration parameter instead.
.IP "\fB-X \fIlog_file\fR (ignored)"
Log mailer traffic. Use the \fBdebug_peer_list\fR and
\fBdebug_peer_level\fR configuration parameters instead.
.IP "\fB-U\fR (ignored)"
Initial user submission.
.IP \fB-V\fR
Variable Envelope Return Path. Given an envelope sender address
of the form \fIowner-listname\fR@\fIorigin\fR, each recipient
\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR receives mail with a personalized envelope
sender address.
.sp
By default, the personalized envelope sender address is
\fIowner-listname\fB+\fIuser\fB=\fIdomain\fR@\fIorigin\fR. The default
\fB+\fR and \fB=\fR characters are configurable with the
\fBdefault_verp_delimiters\fR configuration parameter.
.IP \fB-V\fIxy\fR
As \fB-V\fR, but uses \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR as the VERP delimiter
characters, instead of the characters specified with the
\fBdefault_verp_delimiters\fR configuration parameter.
.IP \fB-bd\fR
Go into daemon mode. This mode of operation is implemented by
executing the \fBpostfix start\fR command.
.IP \fB-bi\fR
Initialize alias database. See the \fBnewaliases\fR
command above.
.IP \fB-bm\fR
Read mail from standard input and arrange for delivery.
This is the default mode of operation.
.IP \fB-bp\fR
List the mail queue. See the \fBmailq\fR command above.
.IP \fB-bs\fR
Stand-alone SMTP server mode. Read SMTP commands from
standard input, and write responses to standard output.
In stand-alone SMTP server mode, UCE restrictions and
access controls are disabled by default. To enable them,
run the process as the \fBmail_owner\fR user.
.sp
This mode of operation is implemented by running the
\fBsmtpd\fR(8) daemon.
.IP "\fB-f \fIsender\fR"
Set the envelope sender address. This is the address where
delivery problems are sent to, unless the message contains an
\fBErrors-To:\fR message header.
.IP "\fB-h \fIhop_count\fR (ignored)"
Hop count limit. Use the \fBhopcount_limit\fR configuration
parameter instead.
.IP "\fB-i\fR"
When reading a message from standard input, don\'t treat a line
with only a \fB.\fR character as the end of input.
.IP "\fB-m\fR (ignored)"
Backwards compatibility.
.IP "\fB-n\fR (ignored)"
Backwards compatibility.
.IP "\fB-oA\fIalias_database\fR"
Non-default alias database. Specify \fIpathname\fR or
\fItype\fR:\fIpathname\fR. See \fBpostalias\fR(1) for
details.
.IP "\fB-o7\fR (ignored)"
.IP "\fB-o8\fR (ignored)"
The message body type. Currently, Postfix implements
\fBjust-send-eight\fR.
.IP "\fB-oi\fR"
When reading a message from standard input, don\'t treat a line
with only a \fB.\fR character as the end of input.
.IP "\fB-om\fR (ignored)"
The sender is never eliminated from alias etc. expansions.
.IP "\fB-o \fIx value\fR (ignored)"
Set option \fIx\fR to \fIvalue\fR. Use the equivalent
configuration parameter in \fBmain.cf\fR instead.
.IP "\fB-r \fIsender\fR"
Set the envelope sender address. This is the address where
delivery problems are sent to, unless the message contains an
\fBErrors-To:\fR message header.
.IP \fB-q\fR
Attempt to deliver all queued mail. This is implemented by
executing the \fBpostqueue\fR(1) command.
.IP "\fB-q\fIinterval\fR (ignored)"
The interval between queue runs. Use the \fBqueue_run_delay\fR
configuration parameter instead.
.IP \fB-qR\fIsite\fR
Schedule immediate delivery of all mail that is queued for the named
\fIsite\fR. This option accepts only \fIsite\fR names that are
eligible for the "fast flush" service, and is implemented by
executing the \fBpostqueue\fR(1) command.
See \fBflush\fR(8) for more information about the "fast flush"
service.
.IP \fB-qS\fIsite\fR
This command is not implemented. Use the slower \fBsendmail -q\fR
command instead.
.IP \fB-t\fR
Extract recipients from message headers. This requires that no
recipients be specified on the command line.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.
.SH SECURITY

it must handle data from untrusted users or untrusted machines.
Thus, the usual precautions need to be taken against malicious
inputs.

Problems are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8) and to the standard error
stream.
