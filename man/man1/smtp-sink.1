.SH DESCRIPTION

\fIsmtp-sink\fR listens on the named host (or address) and port.
It takes SMTP messages from the network and throws them away.
The purpose is to measure SMTP client performance, not protocol
compliance.
Connections can be accepted on IPV4 endpoints or UNIX-domain sockets.
IPV4 is the default.
This program is the complement of the \fIsmtp-source\fR program.

Arguments:
.IP \fB-c\fR
Display a running counter that is updated whenever an SMTP
QUIT command is executed.
.IP \fB-e\fR
Disable ESMTP support.
.IP \fB-h\fI hostname\fR
Use \fIhostname\fR in the SMTP greeting, in the HELO response,
and in the EHLO response. The default hostname is "smtp-sink".
.IP \fB-L\fR
Enable LMTP rather than SMTP.
.IP "\fB-n \fIcount\fR"
Terminate after \fIcount\fR sessions. This is for testing purposes.
.IP \fB-p\fR
Disable ESMTP command pipelining.
.IP \fB-P\fR
Change the server greeting so that it appears to come through
a CISCO PIX system.
.IP "\fB-s \fIcommand,command,...\fR"
Log the named commands to syslogd.
Examples of commands that can be logged are HELO, EHLO, LHLO, MAIL,
RCPT, VRFY, RSET, NOOP, and QUIT. Separate command names by white
space or commas, and use quotes to protect white space from the
shell. Command names are case-insensitive.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Show the SMTP conversations.
.IP "\fB-w \fIdelay\fR"
Wait \fIdelay\fR seconds before responding to a DATA command.
.IP \fB-8\fR
Disable 8BITMIME support.
.IP [\fBinet:\fR][\fIhost\fR]:\fIport\fR
Listen on network interface \fIhost\fR (default: any interface)
TCP port \fIport\fR. Both \fIhost\fR and \fIport\fR may be
specified in numeric or symbolic form.
.IP \fBunix:\fR\fIpathname\fR
Listen on the UNIX-domain socket at \fIpathname\fR.
.IP \fIbacklog\fR
The maximum length the queue of pending connections,
as defined by the listen(2) call.
