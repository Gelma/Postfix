lock mail folder and execute command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
.fi
\fBpostlock\fR [\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fB] [\fB-v\fR]
\fIfile command...\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostlock\fR command locks \fIfile\fR for exclusive
access, and executes \fIcommand\fR. The locking method is
compatible with the Postfix UNIX-style local delivery agent.

Options:
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
Read configuration information from \fBmain.cf\fR in the named
configuration directory.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.
.PP
Arguments:
.IP \fIfile\fR
A mailbox file. The user should have read/write permission.
.IP \fIcommand...\fR
The command to execute while \fIfile\fR is locked for exclusive
access.  The command is executed directly, i.e. without
interpretation by a shell command interpreter.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
The result status is 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL) when the file is locked by
another process, 255 (on some systems: -1) when \fBpostlock\fR
could not perform the requested operation.  Otherwise, the
exit status is the exit status from the command.
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
With remote file systems, the ability to acquire a lock does not
necessarily eliminate access conflicts. Avoid file access by
processes running on different machines.
