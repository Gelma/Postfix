.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostqueue\fR program implements the Postfix user interface
for queue management. It implements all the operations that are
traditionally available via the \fBsendmail\fR(1) command.

The following options are recognized:
.IP "\fB-c \fIconfig_dir\fR"
The \fBmain.cf\fR configuration file is in the named directory
instead of the default configuration directory. See also the
MAIL_CONFIG environment setting below.
.IP \fB-f\fR
Flush the queue: attempt to deliver all queued mail.

This option implements the traditional \fBsendmail -q\fR command,
by contacting the Postfix \fBqmgr\fR(8) daemon.
.IP \fB-p\fR
Produce a traditional sendmail-style queue listing.
This option implements the traditional \fBmailq\fR command,
by contacting the Postfix \fBshowq\fR(8) daemon.

Each queue entry shows the queue file ID, message
size, arrival time, sender, and the recipients that still need to
be delivered.  If mail could not be delivered upon the last attempt,
the reason for failure is shown. This mode of operation is implemented
by executing the \fBpostqueue\fR(1) command. The queue ID string
is followed by an optional status character:
.RS
.IP \fB*\fR
The message is in the \fBactive\fR queue, i.e. the message is
selected for delivery.
.IP \fB!\fR
The message is in the \fBhold\fR queue, i.e. no further delivery
attempt will be made until the mail is taken off hold.
.RE
.IP "\fB-s \fIsite\fR"
Schedule immediate delivery of all mail that is queued for the named
\fIsite\fR. The site must be eligible for the "fast flush" service.
See \fBflush\fR(8) for more information about the "fast flush"
service.

This option implements the traditional \fBsendmail -qR\fIsite\fR
command, by contacting the Postfix \fBflush\fR(8) daemon.
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.
.SH SECURITY
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
This program is designed to run with set-group ID privileges, so
that it can connect to Postfix daemon processes.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8) and to the standard error
stream.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
.IP MAIL_CONFIG
Directory with the \fBmain.cf\fR file.

In order to avoid exploitation of set-group ID privileges, it is not
possible to specify arbitrary directory names.

A non-standard directory is allowed only if the name is listed in the
standard \fBmain.cf\fR file, in the \fBalternate_config_directories\fR
configuration parameter value.

Only the superuser is allowed to specify arbitrary directory names.

.IP \fBimport_environment\fR
List of names of environment parameters that can be imported
from non-Postfix processes.
.IP \fBqueue_directory\fR
Top-level directory of the Postfix queue. This is also the root
directory of Postfix daemons that run chrooted.
.IP \fBfast_flush_domains\fR
List of domains that will receive "fast flush" service (default: all
domains that this system is willing to relay mail to). This list
specifies the domains that Postfix accepts in the SMTP \fBETRN\fR
request and in the \fBsendmail -qR\fR command.
