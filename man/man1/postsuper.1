.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostsuper\fR command does maintenance jobs on the Postfix
queue. Use of the command is restricted to the super-user.

By default, \fBpostsuper\fR performs the operations requested with the
\fB-s\fR and \fB-p\fR command-line options on all Postfix queue
directories - this includes the \fBincoming\fR, \fBactive\fR and
\fBdeferred\fR directories with mail files and the \fBbounce\fR,
\fBdefer\fR and \fBflush\fR directories with log files.

Options:
.IP "\fB-d \fIqueue_id\fR"
Delete one message with the named queue ID from the named
mail queue(s) (default: \fBincoming\fR, \fBactive\fR and
\fBdeferred\fR).
If a \fIqueue_id\fR of \fB-\fR is specified, the program reads
queue IDs from standard input.
.sp
Specify \fB-d ALL\fR to remove all messages; for example, specify
\fB-d ALL deferred\fR to delete mail in the \fBdeferred\fR queue.
As a safety measure, the word \fBALL\fR must be specified in upper
case.
.sp
.ft B
Postfix queue IDs are reused.
There is a very small possibility that postsuper deletes the
wrong message file when it is executed while the Postfix mail
system is running.
.ft R
.sp
The scenario is as follows:
.RS
.IP 1)
The Postfix queue manager deletes the message that \fBpostsuper\fR
is supposed to delete, because Postfix is finished with the
message.
.IP 2)
New mail arrives, and the new message is given the same queue ID
as the message that \fBpostsuper\fR is supposed to delete.
The probability for reusing a deleted queue ID is about 1 in 2**15
(the number of different microsecond values that the system clock
can distinguish within a second).
.IP 3)
\fBpostsuper\fR deletes the new message, instead of the old
message that it should have deleted.
.RE
.IP \fB-p\fR
Purge old temporary files that are left over after system or
software crashes.
.IP "\fB-r \fIqueue_id\fR"
Requeue the message with the named queue ID from the named
mail queue(s) (default: \fBincoming\fR, \fBactive\fR and
\fBdeferred\fR).
To requeue multiple messages, specify multiple \fB-r\fR
command-line options.
Alternatively, if a \fIqueue_id\fR of \fB-\fR is specified,
the program reads queue IDs from standard input.
.sp
Specify \fB-r ALL\fR to requeue all messages. As a safety
measure, the word \fBALL\fR must be specified in upper case.
.sp
A requeued message is moved to the \fBmaildrop\fR queue, from
where it is copied by the pickup daemon to a new file whose name
is guaranteed to match the new queue file inode number. The
new queue file is subjected again to mail address rewriting and
substitution. This is useful when rewriting rules or virtual
mappings have changed.
.sp
Postfix queue IDs are reused.
There is a very small possibility that \fBpostsuper\fR requeues
the wrong message file when it is executed while the Postfix mail
system is running, but no harm should be done.
.IP \fB-s\fR
Structure check and structure repair.  It is highly recommended
to perform this operation once before Postfix startup.
.RS
.IP \(bu
Rename files whose name does not match the message file inode
number. This operation is necessary after restoring a mail queue
from a different machine, or from backup media.
.IP \(bu
Move queue files that are in the wrong place in the file system
hierarchy and remove subdirectories that are no longer needed.
File position rearrangements are necessary after a change in the
\fBhash_queue_names\fR and/or \fBhash_queue_depth\fR
configuration parameters.
.RE
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems are reported to the standard error stream and to
\fBsyslogd\fR.

\fBpostsuper\fR reports the number of messages deleted with \fB-d\fR,
the number of messages requeued with \fB-r\fR, and the number of
messages whose queue file name was fixed with \fB-s\fR. The report
is written to the standard error stream and to \fBsyslogd\fR.
