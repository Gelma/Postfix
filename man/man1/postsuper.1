\fBpostsuper\fR [\fB-p\fR] [\fB-s\fR] [\fB-v\fR] [\fIdirectory ...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpostsuper\fR command does small maintenance jobs on the named
Postfix queue directories (default: all).
Directory names are relative to the Postfix top-level queue directory.

By default, \fBpostsuper\fR performs the operations requested with the
\fB-s\fR and \fB-p\fR command-line options.
\fBpostsuper\fR always tries to remove objects that are neither files
nor directories.  Use of this command is restricted to the super-user.

Options:
.IP \fB-s\fR
Structure check.  Move queue files that are in the wrong place
in the file system hierarchy and remove subdirectories that are
no longer needed. File rearrangements are necessary after a change
in the \fBhash_queue_names\fR and/or \fBhash_queue_depth\fR
configuration parameters. It is highly recommended to run this
check once before Postfix startup.
.IP \fB-p\fR
Purge stale files (files that are left over after system or
software crashes).
.IP \fB-v\fR
Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Multiple \fB-v\fR
options make the software increasingly verbose.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS

Problems are reported to the standard error stream and to
\fBsyslogd\fR.
