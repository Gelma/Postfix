format of Postfix canonical table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/canonical\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The optional \fBcanonical\fR file specifies an address mapping for
local and non-local addresses. The mapping is used by the
\fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon.  The address mapping is recursive.

The file serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command. The result,
an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format, is used for
fast searching by the mail system. After an update
it may take a minute or so before the change becomes visible.
Issue a \fBpostfix reload\fR command to eliminate the delay.

The \fBcanonical\fR mapping affects both message header addresses
(i.e. addresses that appear inside messages) and message envelope
addresses (for example, the addresses that are used in SMTP protocol
commands). Think Sendmail rule set \fBS3\fR, if you like.

Typically, one would use the \fBcanonical\fR table to replace login
names by \fIFirstname.Lastname\fR, or to clean up addresses produced
by legacy mail systems.

The \fBcanonical\fR mapping is not to be confused with \fIvirtual
domain\fR support. Use the \fBvirtual\fR(5) map for that purpose.

The \fBcanonical\fR mapping is not to be confused with local aliasing.
Use the \fBaliases\fR(5) map for that purpose.

The format of the \fBcanonical\fR table is as follows, mappings
being tried in the order as listed in this manual page:
.IP "blanks and comments"
Blank lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with `#'.
.IP "\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain address\fR"
\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR is replaced by \fIaddress\fR. This form
has the highest precedence.
.sp
This form useful to clean up addresses produced by legacy mail systems.
It can also be used to produce \fIFirstname.Lastname\fR style
addresses, but see below for a simpler solution.
.IP "\fIuser address\fR"
\fIuser\fR@\fIsite\fR is replaced by \fIaddress\fR when \fIsite\fR is
equal to $\fBmyorigin\fR, when \fIsite\fR is listed in
$\fBmydestination\fR, or when it is listed in $\fBinet_interfaces\fR.
.sp
This form is useful for replacing login names by
\fIFirstname.Lastname\fR.
.IP "@\fIdomain address\fR"
Every address in \fIdomain\fR is replaced by \fIaddress\fR.
This form has the lowest precedence.
.PP
In all the above forms, when \fIaddress\fR has the form
@\fIotherdomain\fR, the result is the same user in \fIotherdomain\fR.
.SH ADDRESS EXTENSION
.na
.nf
.fi
.ad
When table lookup fails, and the address localpart contains the
optional recipient delimiter (e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR), the
search is repeated for the unextended address (e.g.
\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR), and the unmatched extension is propagated
to the result of table lookup. The matching order is:
\fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR,
\fIuser+foo\fR, \fIuser\fR, and @\fIdomain\fR.
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
.SH CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
this topic. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details
and for default values. Use the \fBpostfix reload\fR command after
a configuration change.
.IP \fBcanonical_maps\fR
List of canonical mapping tables.
.IP \fBrecipient_canonical_maps\fR
Address mapping lookup table for envelope and header recipient
addresses.
.IP \fBsender_canonical_maps\fR
Address mapping lookup table for envelope and header sender
addresses.
.PP
Other parameters of interest:
.IP \fBinet_interfaces\fR
The network interface addresses that this system receives mail on.
.IP \fBmasquerade_domains\fR
List of domains that hide their subdomain structure.
.IP \fBmasquerade_exceptions\fR
List of user names that are not subject to address masquerading.
.IP \fBmydestination\fR
List of domains that this mail system considers local.
.IP \fBmyorigin\fR
The domain that is appended to locally-posted mail.
.IP \fBowner_request_special\fR
Give special treatment to \fBowner-\fIxxx\fR and \fIxxx\fB-request\fR
addresses.
