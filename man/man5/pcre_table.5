.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The Postfix mail system uses optional tables for address
rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in
\fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format. Alternatively, lookup tables
can be specified in Perl Compatible Regular Expression form.

To find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix system
supports use the \fBpostconf -m\fR command.

The general form of a PCRE table is:
.IP "\fIpattern result\fR"
When \fIpattern\fR matches a search string, use the corresponding
\fIresult\fR.
.IP "blank lines and comments"
Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
.IP "multi-line text"
A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
.PP
Each pattern is a perl-like regular expression. The expression
delimiter can be any character, except whitespace or characters
that have special meaning (traditionally the forward slash is used).
The regular expression can contain whitespace.

By default, matching is case-insensitive, although following
the second slash with an `i' flag will reverse this. Other flags
are supported, but the only other useful one is `U', which makes
matching ungreedy (see PCRE documentation and source for more
info).

Each pattern is applied to the entire lookup key string.
Depending on the application, that string is an entire client
hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire mail address.
Thus, no parent domain or parent network search is done, and
\fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not broken up into their
\fIuser\fR and \fIdomain\fR constituent parts, nor is \fIuser+foo\fR
broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.

Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
pattern is found that matches the search string.

Substitution of substrings from the matched expression into the result
string is possible using the conventional perl syntax ($1, $2, etc.).
The macros in the result string may need to be written as ${n}
or $(n) if they aren't followed by whitespace.

.nf
# Protect your outgoing majordomo exploders
/^(?!owner-)(.*)-outgoing@/     550 Use ${1}@${2} instead

# Bounce friend@whatever, except when whatever is our domain (you would
# be better just bouncing all friend@ mail - this is just an example).
/^friend@(?!my\\.domain)/        550 Stick this in your pipe $0

# A multi-line entry. The text is sent as one line.
#
/^noddy@my\\.domain$/
\ 550 This user is a funny one. You really don't want to send mail to
\ them as it only makes their head spin.
