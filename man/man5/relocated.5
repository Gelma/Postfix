relocated

format of Postfix relocated table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/relocated\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The optional \fBrelocated\fR file provides the information that is
used in "user has moved to \fInew_location\fR" bounce messages.

The file serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command. The result,
an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format, is used for
fast searching by the mail system. After an update
issue a \fBpostfix reload\fR command to make the change visible.

Table lookups are case insensitive.

The format of the table is as follows:
.IP \(bu
Blank lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with `#'.
.IP \(bu
An entry has one of the following form:
.ti +5
\fIkey  new_location\fR
.br
Where \fInew_location\fR specifies contact information such as
an email address, or perhaps a street address or telephone number.
.PP
The \fIkey\fR field is one of the following:
.IP \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR
Matches \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR. This form has precedence over all
other forms.
.IP \fIuser\fR
Matches \fIuser\fR@\fIsite\fR when \fIsite\fR is $\fBmyorigin\fR,
when \fIsite\fR is listed in $\fBmydestination\fR, or when \fIsite\fR
is listed in $\fBinet_interfaces\fR.
.IP @\fIdomain\fR
Matches every address in \fIdomain\fR. This form has the lowest
precedence.
.SH ADDRESS EXTENSION
.na
.nf
.fi
.ad
When the search fails, and the address localpart contains the
optional recipient delimiter (e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR),
the search is repeated for the unextended address (e.g.
\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR).
.SH BUGS

.fi
The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
