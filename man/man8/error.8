Postfix error mailer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
\fBerror\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The Postfix error mailer processes message delivery requests from
the queue manager. Each request specifies a queue file, a sender
address, a domain or host name that is treated as the reason for
non-delivery, and recipient information.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.

The error mailer client forces all recipients to bounce, using the
domain or host information as the reason for non-delivery, updates
the queue file and marks recipients as finished, or it informs the
queue manager that delivery should be tried again at a later time.

Delivery problem reports are sent to the \fBbounce\fR(8) or
\fBdefer\fR(8) daemon as appropriate.
