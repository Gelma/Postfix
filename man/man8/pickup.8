Postfix local mail pickup
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
\fBpickup\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The \fBpickup\fR daemon waits for hints that new mail has been
dropped into the \fBmaildrop\fR directory, and feeds it into the
\fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon.
Ill-formatted files are deleted without notifying the originator.
This program expects to be run from the \fBmaster\fR(8) process
manager.
.SH STANDARDS
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
None. The \fBpickup\fR daemon does not interact with the outside world.
.SH SECURITY
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The \fBpickup\fR daemon is moderately security sensitive. It runs
with fixed low privilege and can run in a chrooted environment.
However, the program reads files from potentially hostile users.
The \fBpickup\fR daemon opens no files for writing, is careful about
what files it opens for reading, and does not actually touch any data
that is sent to its public service endpoint.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The \fBpickup\fR daemon copies mail from file to the \fBcleanup\fR(8)
daemon.  It could avoid message copying overhead by sending a file
descriptor instead of file data, but then the already complex
\fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon would have to deal with unfiltered user data.
.SH CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
this program. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details
and for default values. Use the \fBpostfix reload\fR command after
a configuration change.
.SH "Content inspection controls"
.IP \fBcontent_filter\fR
The name of a mail delivery transport that filters mail and that
either bounces mail or re-injects the result back into Postfix.
This parameter uses the same syntax as the right-hand side of
a Postfix transport table.
.SH Miscellaneous
.ad
.fi
.IP \fBalways_bcc\fR
Address to send a copy of each message that enters the system.
.IP \fBqueue_directory\fR
Top-level directory of the Postfix queue.
