Postfix QMQP server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.na
.nf
\fBqmqpd\fR [generic Postfix daemon options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.ad
.fi
The Postfix QMQP server receives one message per connection.
Each message is piped through the \fBcleanup\fR(8)
daemon, and is placed into the \fBincoming\fR queue as one
single queue file.  The program expects to be run from the
\fBmaster\fR(8) process manager.

The QMQP server implements one access policy: only explicitly
authorized client hosts are allowed to use the service.
.SH SECURITY
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The QMQP server is moderately security-sensitive. It talks to QMQP
clients and to DNS servers on the network. The QMQP server can be
run chrooted at fixed low privilege.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.ad
.fi
Problems and transactions are logged to \fBsyslogd\fR(8).
.SH BUGS
.ad
.fi
The QMQP protocol provides only one server reply per message
delivery. It is therefore not possible to reject individual
recipients.

The QMQP protocol requires the server to receive the entire
message before replying. If a message is malformed, or if any
netstring component is longer than acceptable, Postfix replies
immediately and closes the connection. It is left up to the
client to handle the situation.
.SH CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
.na
.nf
.ad
.fi
The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
this program. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details
and for default values. Use the \fBpostfix reload\fR command after
a configuration change.
.SH Miscellaneous
.ad
.fi
.IP \fBalways_bcc\fR
Address to send a copy of each message that enters the system.
.IP \fBdebug_peer_level\fR
Increment in verbose logging level when a remote host matches a
pattern in the \fBdebug_peer_list\fR parameter.
.IP \fBdebug_peer_list\fR
List of domain or network patterns. When a remote host matches
a pattern, increase the verbose logging level by the amount
specified in the \fBdebug_peer_level\fR parameter.
.IP \fBhopcount_limit\fR
Limit the number of \fBReceived:\fR message headers.
.IP \fBqmqpd_authorized_clients\fR
A list of domain or network patterns that specifies what
clients are allowed to use the service.
.IP \fBqmqpd_timeout\fR
Limit the time to send a server response and to receive a client
request.
.IP \fBsoft_bounce\fR
Change hard (D) reject responses into soft (Z) reject responses.
This can be useful for testing purposes.
.SH "Content inspection controls"
.IP \fBcontent_filter\fR
The name of a mail delivery transport that filters mail and that
either bounces mail or re-injects the result back into Postfix.
This parameter uses the same syntax as the right-hand side of
a Postfix transport table.
.SH "Resource controls"
.ad
.fi
.IP \fBline_length_limit\fR
Limit the amount of memory in bytes used for the handling of
partial input lines, and the length of sender and recipient
addresses that are received from client.
.IP \fBmessage_size_limit\fR
Limit the total size in bytes of a message, including on-disk
storage for sender and recipient address information.
.SH Tarpitting
.ad
.fi
.IP \fBqmqpd_error_delay\fR
Time to wait in seconds before informing the client of
a problem. This slows down run-away errors.
