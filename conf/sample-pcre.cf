#	Sample pcre (PERL-compatible regular expression) map file
#
#	The first field is a perl-like regular expression. The expression
#	delimiter can be any character except whitespace, or characters
#	that have special meaning to the regexp library (traditionally
#	the forward slash is used). The regular expression can contain
#	whitespace.
#
#	By default, matching is case-INsensitive, although following
#	the second slash with an 'i' will reverse this. Other flags are
#	supported, but the only other useful one is 'U', which makes
#	matching ungreedy (see PCRE documentation and source for more
#	info).
#
#	The second field is the "replacement" string - the text
#	returned by the match. When used for smtpd checks, this would
#	be a helpful message to misguided users (or an offensive
#	message to spammers), although it could also be a domain name
#	or other data for use as a transport, virtual, or other map.
#
#	Substitution of sub-strings from the matched expression is
#	possible using the conventional perl syntax. The macros in the
#	replacement string may need to be protected with curly braces
#	if they aren't followed by whitespace (see the examples
#	below).
#
#	Lines starting with whitespace are continuation lines - they are
#	appended to the previous line (there should be no whitespace
#	before your regular expression!)
#
#	This code was originally developed for SPAM control. However
#	it seems that it can be used equally well for address rewriting
#	by virtual or canonical lookups. Using this for aliases might 
#	be stretching things, though.

# Bounce friend@whatever, except when whatever is our domain (you would
# be better just bouncing all friend@ mail - this is just an example).

/^friend@(?!connect.com.au).*$/		550 Stick this in your pipe $0

 550 This user is a funny one. You really don't want to send mail to them
 as it only makes their head spin.
