# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. EDIT THE MAIN.CF FILE INSTEAD. THE STUFF
# HERE JUST SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE.
#
# This file contains example settings of general Postfix resource
# control parameters.
# 
# Controls that are specific to message delivery transports are
# described in the respective sample-transportname.cf file.

# The bounce_size_limit parameter limits the amount of original
# message context in bytes that is sent in a non-delivery notification.
#
bounce_size_limit = 50000

# The command_time_limit parameter limits the amount of time for
# delivery to external commands. This limit is used by the local
# delivery agent, and is the default time limit for delivery by the
# pipe mailer.
#
# Note: if you set this time limit to a large value you must update the
# global ipc_timeout parameter as well. See sample-misc.cf for details.
#
command_time_limit = 1000

# The default_process_limit parameter specifies the default limit
# on the number of Postfix child processes that provide a given
# service.
#
default_process_limit = 50

# The deliver_lock_attempts parameter limits the number of attempts
# to acquire an exclusive lock on a mailbox or other file. 
#
deliver_lock_attempts = 5

# The deliver_lock_delay parameter specifies the time between attempts
# to acquire an exclusive lock.
#
# Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
# The default time unit is s (seconds).
#
deliver_lock_delay = 1s

# The duplicate_filter_limit parameter limits the number of addresses
# remembered by the duplicate filter for alias, virtual, etc.
# expansion.
#
duplicate_filter_limit = 1000

# The fork_attempts parameter limits the number of attempts to
# fork() a process.
#
fork_attempts = 5

# The fork_delay parameter specifies the delay between attempts to
# fork() an external process.
#
# Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
# The default time unit is s (seconds).
#
fork_delay = 1s

# The header_size_limit parameter limits the amount of memory in
# bytes used for processing a message header. If a header is larger,
# the remainder of the entire message is treated as message body.
#
header_size_limit = 102400

# The line_length_limit parameter limits the amount of memory in
# bytes used for handling input lines. Longer lines are chopped up
# into pieces and reconstructed upon delivery.

# The message_size_limit parameter limits the total size in bytes of
# a message, including envelope information.

# The qmgr_message_active_limit parameter limits the number of
# messages in the active queue.
#
qmgr_message_active_limit = 1000

# The qmgr_message_recipient_limit parameter limits the number of
# in-memory recipients. This parameter also limits the size of the
# short-term, in-memory destination status cache.
#
qmgr_message_recipient_limit = 1000

# The queue_minfree parameter specifies the minimal amount of free
# space in bytes in the queue file system. This is currently used by
# the SMTP server to decide if it will accept any mail at all.
#
queue_minfree = 0

# The stale_lock_time parameter limits the time after which a stale
# lock is removed. This is used for delivery to file or mailbox.
#
# Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
# The default time unit is s (seconds).
#
stale_lock_time = 500s

# The transport_retry_time parameter specifies the time between
# attempts by the queue manager to contact a broken message delivery
# transport.
#
# Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
# The default time unit is s (seconds).
