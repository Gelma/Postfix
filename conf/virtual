# NAME
#	virtual 5
# SUMMARY
#	format of Postfix virtual table
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/virtual\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The optional \fBvirtual\fR table specifies redirections for local
#	and non-local recipients or domains. The redirections are used by
#	the \fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon. The redirections are recursive.
#
#	The \fBvirtual\fR redirection is applied only to the recipient
#	envelope address, and does not affect message headers.
#	Think Sendmail rule set \fBS0\fR, if you like. Use \fBcanonical\fR(5)
#	mapping to rewrite header and envelope addresses in general.
#
#	The file serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command. The
#	result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format,
#	is used for fast searching by the mail system. After an update
#	it may take a minute or so before the change becomes visible.
#	Issue a \fBpostfix reload\fR command to eliminate the delay.
#
#	Typical support for a virtual domain looks like the following:
#
# .in +4
# .nf
#	\fIvirtual.domain	anything\fR (right-hand content does not matter)
#	\fIuser1@virtual.domain	address1\fR
#	\fIuser2@virtual.domain	address2, address3\fR
# .fi
# .in -4
#
#	With this, the SMTP server accepts mail for \fIvirtual.domain\fR and
#	rejects mail for \fIunknown\fR@\fIvirtual.domain\fR as undeliverable.
#
#	The format of the virtual table is as follows, mappings being
#	tried in the order as listed in this manual page:
# .IP "blanks and comments"
#	Blank lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with `#'.
# .IP "\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain address, address, ...\fR"
#	Mail for \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR is redirected to \fIaddress\fR.
#	This form has the highest precedence.
# .IP "\fIuser address, address, ...\fR"
#	Mail for \fIuser\fR@\fIsite\fR is redirected to \fIaddress\fR when
#	\fIsite\fR is equal to $\fBmyorigin\fR, when \fIsite\fR is listed in
#	$\fRmydestination\fR, or when it is listed in $\fIinet_interfaces\fR.
#	.sp
#	This functionality overlaps with functionality of the local
#	\fIalias\fR(5) database. The difference is that \fBvirtual\fR
#	mapping can be applied to non-local addresses.
# .IP "@\fIdomain address, address, ...\fR"
#	Mail for any user in \fIdomain\fR is redirected to \fIaddress\fR.
#	This form has the lowest precedence.
# .PP
#	In all the above forms, when \fIaddress\fR has the form
#	@\fIotherdomain\fR, the result is the same user in \fIotherdomain\fR.
#	This works for the first address in the expansion only.
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
# .fi
# .ad
#	When the search fails, and the address localpart contains the
#	optional recipient delimiter (e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR),
#	the search is repeated for the unextended address (e.g.
#	\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR), and the unmatched address extension is
#	propagated to the result of expansion. The matching order is:
#	\fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR,
#	\fIuser+foo\fR, \fIuser\fR, and @\fIdomain\fR.
# BUGS
#	The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
# .ad
# .fi
#	The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
#	this topic. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details
#	and for default values. Use the \fBpostfix reload\fR command after
#	a configuration change.
# .IP \fBvirtual_maps\fR
#	List of virtual mapping tables.
# .PP
#	Other parameters of interest:
# .IP \fBinet_interfaces\fR
#	The network interface addresses that this system receives mail on.
# .IP \fBmydestination\fR
#	List of domains that this mail system considers local.
# .IP \fBmyorigin\fR
#	The domain that is appended to locally-posted mail.
# .IP \fBowner_request_special\fR
#	Give special treatment to \fBowner-\fIxxx\fR and \fIxxx\fB-request\fR
#	addresses.
