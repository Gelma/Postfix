# ACCESS(5)                                               ACCESS(5)
# 
# NAME
#        access - format of Postfix access table
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        postmap /etc/postfix/access
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  optional access table directs the Postfix SMTP server
#        to selectively  reject  or  accept  mail.  Access  can  be
#        allowed  or  denied for specific host names, domain names,
#        networks, host network addresses or mail addresses.
# 
#        Normally, the access table is specified  as  a  text  file
#        that  serves  as  input  to  the  postmap(1) command.  The
#        result, an indexed file in dbm or db format, is  used  for
#        fast  searching  by  the  mail system. Execute the command
#        postmap  /etc/postfix/access  in  order  to  rebuild   the
#        indexed file after changing the access table.
# 
#        When  the  table  is provided via other means such as NIS,
#        LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are  done  as  for  ordinary
#        indexed files.
# 
#        Alternatively,  the  table  can  be provided as a regular-
#        expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
#        sions.  In  that  case, the lookups are done in a slightly
#        different way as described below.
# 
# TABLE FORMAT
#        The format of the access table is as follows:
# 
#        pattern action
#               When pattern matches a mail address, domain or host
#               address, perform the corresponding action.
# 
#        blank lines and comments
#               Empty  lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored,
#               as are lines whose first  non-whitespace  character
#               is a `#'.
# 
#        multi-line text
#               A  logical  line starts with non-whitespace text. A
#               line that starts with whitespace continues a  logi-
#               cal line.
# 
# EMAIL ADDRESS PATTERNS
#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
#        networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL,  the  following
#        lookup patterns are examined in the order as listed:
# 
#        user@domain
#               Matches the specified mail address.
# 
#        domain.name
#               Matches  domain.name as the domain part of an email
#               address.
# 
#               The pattern domain.name  also  matches  subdomains,
#               but  only  when  the  string  smtpd_access_maps  is
#               listed in the Postfix  parent_domain_matches_subdo-
#               mains  configuration  setting.   Otherwise, specify
#               .domain.name (note the initial  dot)  in  order  to
#               match subdomains.
# 
#        user@  Matches  all mail addresses with the specified user
#               part.
# 
#        Note: lookup of the null sender address may not be  possi-
#        ble with all supported types of lookup table. A workaround
#        is to specify smtpd_null_access_lookup_key  =  <>  in  the
#        Postfix  main.cf  file, and to specify <> as the left-hand
#        field in the access table.
# 
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
#        When a mail address localpart contains the optional recip-
#        ient  delimiter  (e.g., user+foo@domain), the lookup order
#        becomes: user+foo@domain, user@domain, domain,  user+foo@,
#        and user@.
# 
# HOST NAME/ADDRESS PATTERNS
#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
#        networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL,  the  following
#        lookup patterns are examined in the order as listed:
# 
#        domain.name
#               Matches domain.name.
# 
#               The  pattern  domain.name  also matches subdomains,
#               but  only  when  the  string  smtpd_access_maps  is
#               listed  in the Postfix parent_domain_matches_subdo-
#               mains configuration  setting.   Otherwise,  specify
#               .domain.name  (note  the  initial  dot) in order to
#               match subdomains.
# 
#        net.work.addr.ess
# 
#        net.work.addr
# 
#        net.work
# 
#        net    Matches any host address in the specified  network.
#               A  network  address  is  a  sequence of one or more
#               octets separated by ".".
# 
# ACTIONS
#        [45]NN text
#               Reject the address etc. that matches  the  pattern,
#               and respond with the numerical code and text.
# 
#        REJECT Reject the address etc. that matches the pattern. A
#               generic error response message is generated.
# 
#        OK     Accept the address etc. that matches the pattern.
# 
#        restriction...
#               Apply the named UCE restriction(s) (permit, reject,
#               reject_unauth_destination, and so on).
# 
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
#        This  section  describes how the table lookups change when
#        the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
#        a  description  of regular expression lookup table syntax,
#        see regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5).
# 
#        Each pattern is a regular expression that  is  applied  to
#        the entire string being looked up. Depending on the appli-
#        cation, that string  is  an  entire  client  hostname,  an
#        entire client IP address, or an entire mail address. Thus,
#        no  parent  domain  or  parent  network  search  is  done,
#        user@domain  mail  addresses  are not broken up into their
#        user@ and domain constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken
#        up into user and foo.
# 
#        Patterns  are  applied  in  the  order as specified in the
#        table, until a pattern is found that  matches  the  search
#        string.
# 
#        Actions  are  the  same as with indexed file lookups, with
#        the additional feature that parenthesized substrings  from
#        the pattern can be interpolated as $1, $2 and so on.
# 
# BUGS
#        The  table format does not understand quoting conventions.
