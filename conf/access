# NAME
#	access 5
# SUMMARY
#	format of Postfix access table
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/access\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The optional \fBaccess\fR table directs the Postfix SMTP server
#	to selectively reject or accept mail from or to specific hosts,
#	domains, networks, host addresses or mail addresses.
#
#	The table serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command. The
#	result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format,
#	is used for fast searching by the mail system. After an update
#	it may take a minute or so before the change becomes visible.
#	Issue a \fBpostfix reload\fR command to eliminate the delay.
#
#	The format of the access table is as follows:
# .IP "blanks and comments"
#	Blank lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with `#'.
# .IP "\fIpattern action\fR"
#	When \fIpattern\fR matches a mail address, domain or host address,
#	perform the corresponding \fIaction\fR.
# PATTERNS
#	Patterns are tried in the order as listed below:
# .ad
# .fi
# .IP \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR
#	Matches the specified mail address.
# .IP \fIdomain.name\fR
#	Matches the \fIdomain.name\fR itself and any subdomain thereof, 
#	either in hostnames or in mail addresses. Top-level domains will 
#	never be matched.
# .IP \fIuser\fR@
#	Matches all mail addresses with the specified user part.
# .IP \fInet.work.addr.ess\fR
# .IP \fInet.work.addr\fR
# .IP \fInet.work\fR
# .IP \fInet\fR
#	Matches any host address in the specified network. A network
#	address is a sequence of one or more octets separated by ".".
# ACTIONS
# .ad
# .fi
# .IP "[\fB45\fR]\fIXX text\fR"
#	Reject the address etc. that matches the pattern, and respond with
#	the numerical code and text.
# .IP \fBREJECT\fR
#	Reject the address etc. that matches the pattern. A generic
#	error response message is generated.
# .IP \fBOK\fR
# .IP "\fIAny other text\fR"
#	Accept the address etc. that matches the pattern.
# BUGS
#	The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
