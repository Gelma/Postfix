# 
# NAME
#        access - format of Postfix access table
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        postmap /etc/postfix/access
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  optional access table directs the Postfix SMTP server
#        to selectively reject or accept mail from or  to  specific
#        hosts,   domains,   networks,   host   addresses  or  mail
#        addresses.
# 
#        Normally, the access table is specified  as  a  text  file
#        that  serves  as  input  to  the  postmap(1) command.  The
#        result, an indexed file in dbm or db format, is  used  for
#        fast  searching  by  the  mail system. Execute the command
#        postmap  /etc/postfix/access  in  order  to  rebuild   the
#        indexed file after changing the access table.
# 
#        When  the  table  is provided via other means such as NIS,
#        LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are  done  as  for  ordinary
#        indexed files.
# 
#        Alternatively,  the  table  can  be provided as a regular-
#        expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
#        sions.  In  that  case, the lookups are done in a slightly
#        different way as described below.
# 
# TABLE FORMAT
#        The format of the access table is as follows:
# 
#        blanks and comments
#               Blank lines are ignored,  as  are  lines  beginning
#               with `#'.
# 
#        leading whitespace
#               Lines  that begin with whitespace continue the pre-
#               vious line.
# 
#        pattern action
#               When pattern matches a mail address, domain or host
#               address, perform the corresponding action.
# 
# PATTERNS
#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
#        networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or  SQL,  patterns  are
#        tried in the order as listed below:
# 
#        user@domain
#               Matches the specified mail address.
# 
#        domain.name
#               Matches  the  domain.name  itself and any subdomain
#               thereof, either in hostnames or in mail  addresses.
# 
#                                                                 1
# 
# ACCESS(5)                                               ACCESS(5)
# 
#               Top-level domains will never be matched.
# 
#        user@  Matches  all mail addresses with the specified user
#               part.
# 
#        net.work.addr.ess
# 
#        net.work.addr
# 
#        net.work
# 
#        net    Matches any host address in the specified  network.
#               A  network  address  is  a  sequence of one or more
#               octets separated by ".".
# 
# ACTIONS
#        [45]NN text
#               Reject the address etc. that matches  the  pattern,
#               and respond with the numerical code and text.
# 
#        REJECT Reject the address etc. that matches the pattern. A
#               generic error response message is generated.
# 
#        OK     Accept the address etc. that matches the pattern.
# 
#        restriction...
#               Apply the named UCE restriction(s) (permit, reject,
#               reject_unauth_destination, and so on).
# 
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
#        This  section  describes how the table lookups change when
#        the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
#        a  description  of regular expression lookup table syntax,
#        see regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5).
# 
#        Each pattern is a regular expression that  is  applied  to
#        the entire string being looked up. Depending on the appli-
#        cation, that string  is  an  entire  client  hostname,  an
#        entire client IP address, or an entire mail address. Thus,
#        no parent domain or parent network  search  is  done,  and
#        user@domain  mail  addresses  are not broken up into their
#        user@ and domain constituent parts.
# 
#        Patterns are applied in the  order  as  specified  in  the
#        table,  until  a  pattern is found that matches the search
#        string.
# 
#        Actions are the same as with normal indexed file  lookups,
#        with  the additional feature that parenthesized substrings
#        from the pattern can be interpolated as $1, $2 and so  on.
# 
# BUGS
#        The  table format does not understand quoting conventions.
# 
#                                                                 2
