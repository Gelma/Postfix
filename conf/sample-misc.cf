# The always_bcc parameter specifies an optional address that
# receives a copy of each message that enters the Postfix system,
# not including bounces that are generated locally.
#
always_bcc =

# The daemon_timeout parameter specifies how much time a daemon may
# take to handle a request before it assumes it is wedged and commits
# suicide.
#
# Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
# The default time unit is s (seconds).
#
daemon_timeout = 18000s

# The default_database_type parameter specifies the default database
# type to use in postalias(1) and postmap(1) commands. On many UNIX
# systems the default type is either `dbm' or `hash'. The default is
# determined when the Postfix system is built.
#
# default_database_type = hash
# default_database_type = dbm

# The default_transport parameter specifies the default message
# delivery transport to use when no transport is explicitly given in
# the optional transport(5) table.
#
# Specify a string of the form transport:nexthop, where transport is
# the name of a mail delivery transport defined in master.cf.  Either
# transport or nexthop are optional. For more details see the sample
# transports file.
#
# default_transport = uucp:relayhostname
default_transport = smtp

# The double_bounce_sender parameter specifies the sender address
# for mail that must be discarded when it cannot be delivered. This
# must be a unique name. All mail to this name is silently discarded,
# in order to terminate mail bounce loops.
#
double_bounce_sender = double-bounce

# The export_environment parameter specifies the names of environment
# parameters that Postfix will export to non-Postfix processes.
# 
# - TZ is needed for sane time keeping on most SYSV-ish systems
# 
# Specify a list of names separated by whitespace or comma.
#
export_environment = TZ

# The hash_queue_depth parameter specifies the number of subdirectory
# levels below the queue directories listed in the hash_queue_names
# parameter.
# 
# Multiple subdirectory levels can speed up directory access by
# reducing the number of files per directory.
#
# After changing the hash_queue_names or hash_queue_depth parameter,
# run "postfix reload" and "postfix check".
#

# The hash_queue_names parameter specifies the names of queue
# directories that are split across multiple subdirectory levels.
# Hashing MUST NOT be used with a world-writable maildrop directory.
# Hashing MUST be used for the defer logfile directory, or mail system
# performance will suffer.
#
# Unfortunately, hashing the incoming or deferred queue can actually
# slow the mail system down (mailq with an empty queue can take
# several seconds) so it should be done only in case of emergency.

# The import_environment parameter specifies the names of environment
# parameters that Postfix processes will import from their parent
# environment.
# 
# - TZ is needed for sane time keeping on most SYSV-ish systems
# - DISPLAY and XAUTHORITY are needed for debugging Postfix daemons
#   with an X-windows debugger.

# The ipc_idle parameter bounds the idle time for internal communication
# channels after which a client disconnects voluntarily. The purpose
# is to allow servers to terminate voluntarily after they become
# idle. Currently this is used by the address resolving and rewriting
# clients.
#
# Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
# The default time unit is s (seconds).
#
ipc_idle = 100s

# The ipc_timeout parameter specifies a timeout for I/O on internal
# communication channels.  The purpose is to break out of deadlock
# situations. If the timeout is exceeded the software aborts with a
# fatal error.
#
# Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
# The default time unit is s (seconds).

# The mail_name parameter specifies the mail system name that is used
# in Received: headers, in the SMTP greeting banner, and in bounced
# mail.
#
mail_name = Postfix

# The mail_owner parameter specifies the owner of the Postfix queue
# and of most Postfix daemon processes.  Specify the name of a user

# The mydestination parameter specifies the list of domains that this
# machine considers itself the final destination for.
#
# The default is $myhostname + localhost.$mydomain.  On a mail domain
# gateway, you should also include $mydomain. Do not specify the
# names of domains that this machine is backup MX host for. Specify
# those names via the relay_domains or permit_mx_backup settings for
# the SMTP server (see sample-smtpd.cf.
#
# The local machine is always the final destination for mail addressed
# to user@[the.net.work.address] of an interface that the mail system
# receives mail on (see the inet_interfaces parameter).
#
# Specify a list of host or domain names, /file/name or type:table
# patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. A /file/name
# pattern is replaced by its contents; a type:table is matched when
# a name matches a lookup key.  Continue long lines by starting the
# next line with whitespace.

# $mydomain is used as a default value for many other configuration
# parameters.
#
#mydomain = domain.name

# mail system. The default is to use the fully-qualified domain name
# from gethostname(). $myhostname is used as a default value for many
# other configuration parameters.
#
#myhostname = host.domain.name

# The myorigin parameter specifies the domain that locally-posted
# mail appears to come from. The default is to append $myhostname,
# which is fine for small sites.  If you run a domain with multiple
# machines, you should (1) change this to $mydomain and (2) set up
# a domain-wide alias database that aliases each user to
# user@that.users.mailhost.
#
# myorigin = $mydomain
myorigin = $myhostname

# The mynetworks parameter specifies the list of "trusted" SMTP
# clients that have more privileges than "strangers".
#
# In particular, "trusted" SMTP clients are allowed to relay mail
# through Postfix.  See the smtpd_recipient_restrictions parameter
# in file sample-smtpd.cf.
#
# You can specify the list of "trusted" network addresses by hand
# or you can let Postfix do it for you (which is the default).
#
# By default (mynetworks_style = subnet), Postfix "trusts" SMTP
# clients in the same IP subnetworks as the local machine.
# 
# Specify "mynetworks_style = class" when Postfix should "trust" SMTP
# clients in the same IP class A/B/C networks as the local machine.
# Don't do this with a dialup site - it would cause Postfix to "trust"
# your entire provider's network.  Instead, specify an explicit
# mynetworks list by hand, as described below.
#  
# Specify "mynetworks_style = host" when Postfix should "trust"
# only the local machine.
# 
# mynetworks_style = class
# mynetworks_style = subnet
# mynetworks_style = host

# Alternatively, you can specify the mynetworks list by hand, in
# which case Postfix ignores the mynetworks_style setting.
#
# Specify an explicit list of network/netmask patterns, where the
# mask specifies the number of bits in the network part of a host
# address.
#
# You can also specify the absolute pathname of a pattern file instead
# of listing the patterns here.
#
#mynetworks = 168.100.189.0/28, 127.0.0.0/8

# The notify_classes parameter specifies the list of error classes
# that are reported to the postmaster. The default is to report only
# the most serious problems. The paranoid may wish to turn on the
# policy (anti-UCE violations) and protocol error (broken mailers)
# reports.
#
# notify_classes = bounce,delay,policy,protocol,resource,software

# The program_directory parameter specifies the location of Postfix
# support programs and daemons. This directory must be owned by root.
#
program_directory = /usr/libexec/postfix

# The queue_directory specifies the location of the Postfix queue.

# The files in the examples/chroot-setup subdirectory describe how
# to set up Postfix chroot environments on different UNIX systems.
#
queue_directory = /var/spool/postfix

# The recipient_delimiter parameter specifies the separator between
# user names and address extensions (user+foo). See canonical(5),
# local(8), relocated(5) and virtual(5) for the effects this has on
# aliases, canonical, virtual, relocated and .forward file lookups.
# Basically, the software tries user+foo and .forward+foo before
# trying user and .forward.
#
# recipient_delimiter = +
recipient_delimiter =

# The propagate_unmatched_extensions parameter specifies what lookup
# tables should copy the address extension from the lookup key to
# the lookup result. 
# 
# For example, with a virtual table entry "joe@domain joe.user",
# the address joe+foo@domain would be rewritten to joe.user+foo.
# Address extensions can be propagated with canonical, virtual,
# and alias maps, as well as with .forward and :include: files,
# including mailing lists!!
#
# By default, only canonical and virtual maps propagate address
# extensions to lookup results. Enabling this feature for other
# types of lookups usually causes problems when mail is forwarded
# to other sites, especially with mail that is sent to a mailing
# list exploder address.

#propagate_unmatched_extensions = canonical, virtual, alias, forward, include
#propagate_unmatched_extensions = canonical, virtual

# The relayhost parameter specifies the default host to send mail to
# when no entry is matched in the optional transport(5) table. When
# no relayhost is given, mail is routed directly to the destination.
# 
# On an intranet, specify the organizational domain name. If your
# internal DNS uses no MX records, specify the name of the intranet
# gateway host instead.
#
# In the case of SMTP, specify a domain, host, host:port, [host]:port,
# [address] or [address]:port; the form [host] turns off MX lookups.
# If you specify multiple SMTP destinations, Postfix will try them
# in the specified order.
#
# If you're connected via UUCP, see also the default_transport parameter.
#
# relayhost = $mydomain
# relayhost = gateway.my.domain

# The relocated_maps parameter specifies optional tables with contact
# information for users, hosts or domains that no longer exist. See
# relocated(5) for details.
# 
# By default, this feature is disabled. 
#
# Specify the types and names of databases to use.  After change,
# run "postmap /etc/postfix/relocated", then "postfix reload".
#
# relocated_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/relocated
relocated_maps =

# The syslog_facility parameter controls where Postfix logging is
# sent by the syslog daemon. Specify a logging facility as defined
# in syslog.conf(5). The default logging facility is "mail".
#
# Beware: a non-default syslog_facility setting takes effect only
# after process initialization. Some initialization errors will be
# logged with the default facility, especially errors while parsing
# the command line and errors while accessing the Postfix main.cf
# configuration file.
#
syslog_facility = mail

# The trigger_timeout parameter limits the time to send a trigger to
# a Postfix daemon. This prevents programs from getting stuck when the
# mail system is under heavy load.
#
# Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
# The default time unit is s (seconds).
#
trigger_timeout = 10s

# The delay_warning_time specifies after how much time a warning
# is sent that mail has not yet been delivered. By default, no warning
# is sent.
#
# Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).
# The default time unit is h (hours).
#
# delay_warning_time = 0h
