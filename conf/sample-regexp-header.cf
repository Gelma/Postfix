# Sample regexp message header filter lookup "table". See regexp_table(5)
# for a description of the syntax.
#
# Message headers are filtered one at a time. This filter understands
# multi-line mail headers. However, the message header filter has no
# knowledge of MIME headers that are embedded in the message body.
#
# The general format of a table entry is PATTERN RESULT. 
#
# The pattern format is /regexp/flags or /regexp/flags!/regexp/flags
# where regexp is a regular expression as found in regexp(5), and flags are
#   i: toggle ignore case (REG_ICASE - default is to ignore case)
#   x: toggle extended expression (REG_EXTENDED - default is extended)
#   m: toggle multiline mode (REG_NEWLINE - default is non-multiline mode)
#
# In order for a line to match, the first regexp must match, and the
# second (if present) must not match.  The first matching line wins,
# terminating processing of the ruleset.
#
# The result is one of the following:
#   REJECT          the entire message is rejected.
#   REJECT text.... The text is sent to the originator.
#   IGNORE          the header line is silently discarded.
#   WARN            the header is logged (not rejected) with a warning.
