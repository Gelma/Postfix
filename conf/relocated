# 
# NAME
#        relocated - format of Postfix relocated table
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        postmap /etc/postfix/relocated
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The optional relocated table provides the information that
#        is used in "user has moved to  new_location"  bounce  mes-
#        sages.
# 
#        Normally,  the relocated table is specified as a text file
#        that serves as  input  to  the  postmap(1)  command.   The
#        result,  an  indexed file in dbm or db format, is used for
#        fast searching by the mail  system.  Execute  the  command
#        postmap  /etc/postfix/relocated  in  order  to rebuild the
#        indexed file after changing the relocated table.
# 
#        When the table is provided via other means  such  as  NIS,
#        LDAP  or  SQL,  the  same lookups are done as for ordinary
#        indexed files.
# 
#        Alternatively, the table can be  provided  as  a  regular-
#        expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
#        sions. In that case, the lookups are done  in  a  slightly
#        different way as described below.
# 
#        Table lookups are case insensitive.
# 
# TABLE FORMAT
#        The format of the table is as follows:
# 
#        o      An entry has one of the following form:
#                    key  new_location
#               Where  new_location  specifies  contact information
#               such as an  email  address,  or  perhaps  a  street
#               address or telephone number.
# 
#        o      Empty  lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored,
#               as are lines whose first  non-whitespace  character
#               is a `#'.
# 
#        o      A  logical  line starts with non-whitespace text. A
#               line that starts with whitespace continues a  logi-
#               cal line.
# 
#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
#        networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the  key  field
#        is one of the following:
# 
#        user@domain
#               Matches  user@domain. This form has precedence over
#               all other forms.
# 
#        user   Matches user@site when site is $myorigin, when site
#               is listed in $mydestination, or when site is listed
#               in $inet_interfaces.
# 
#        @domain
#               Matches every address in domain. This form has  the
#               lowest precedence.
# 
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
#        When a mail address localpart contains the optional recip-
#        ient delimiter (e.g., user+foo@domain), the  lookup  order
#        becomes: user+foo@domain, user@domain, user+foo, user, and
#        @domain.
# 
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
#        This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
#        the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
#        a description of regular expression lookup  table  syntax,
#        see regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5).
# 
#        Each  pattern  is  a regular expression that is applied to
#        the entire address being looked up. Thus, user@domain mail
#        addresses  are  not  broken up into their user and @domain
#        constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken up into user and
#        foo.
# 
#        Patterns  are  applied  in  the  order as specified in the
#        table, until a pattern is found that  matches  the  search
#        string.
# 
#        Results  are  the  same as with indexed file lookups, with
#        the additional feature that parenthesized substrings  from
#        the pattern can be interpolated as $1, $2 and so on.
# 
# BUGS
#        The  table format does not understand quoting conventions.
# 
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
#        The following main.cf parameters are  especially  relevant
