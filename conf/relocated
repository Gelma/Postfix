# NAME
#	relocated 5
# SUMMARY
#	format of Postfix relocated table
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/relocated\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The optional \fBrelocated\fR file provides the information that is
#	used in "user has moved to \fInew_location\fR" bounce messages.
#
#	The file serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command. The result,
#	an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format, is used for
#	fast searching by the mail system. After an update
#	issue a \fBpostfix reload\fR command to make the change visible.
#
#	Table lookups are case insensitive.
#
#	The format of the table is as follows:
# .IP \(bu
#	Blank lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with `#'.
# .IP \(bu
#	An entry has one of the following form:
# .ti +5
#	\fIkey	new_location\fR
# .br
#	Where \fInew_location\fR specifies contact information such as
#	an email address, or perhaps a street address or telephone number.
# .PP
#	The \fIkey\fR field is one of the following:
# .IP \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR
#	Matches \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR. This form has precedence over all
#	other forms.
# .IP \fIuser\fR
#	Matches \fIuser\fR@\fIsite\fR when \fIsite\fR is $\fBmyorigin\fR,
#	when \fIsite\fR is listed in $\fBmydestination\fR, or when \fIsite\fR
#	is listed in $\fBinet_interfaces\fR.
# .IP @\fIdomain\fR
#	Matches every address in \fIdomain\fR. This form has the lowest
#	precedence.
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
# .fi
# .ad
#	When the search fails, and the address localpart contains the
#	optional recipient delimiter (e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR),
#	the search is repeated for the unextended address (e.g.
#	\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR).
# BUGS
#	The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS

#	The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
#	this topic. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details
#	and for default values. Use the \fBpostfix reload\fR command after
#	a configuration change.
