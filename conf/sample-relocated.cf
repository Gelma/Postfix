# This file contains example settings of Postfix configuration

# The relocated_maps parameter specifies optional lookup tables with
# new contact information for users or even domains that no longer
# exist.

# By default, this feature is disabled.
#
# If you use this feature, run "postmap /etc/postfix/relocated" to 
# build the necessary DBM or DB file after change, then "postfix
# reload" to make the changes visible.
