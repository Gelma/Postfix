# 
#	Sample pcre (PERL-compatible regular expression) map file for
#	mail body filtering. See pcre_table(5) for syntax description.
#
#	Mail body lines are filtered one line at a time. In particular,
#	multi-line MIME headers in the message body are filtered one text
#	line at a time.
#
#	The first field is a perl-like regular expression. The expression
#	delimiter can be any character except whitespace, or characters
#	that have special meaning to the regexp library (traditionally
#	the forward slash is used). The regular expression can contain
#	whitespace.
#
#	By default, matching is case-INsensitive, although following
#	the second slash with an 'i' will reverse this. Other flags are
#	supported, but the only other useful one is 'U', which makes
#	matching ungreedy (see PCRE documentation and source for more
#	info).
#
#	The second field is the "replacement" string - the text
#	returned by the match. 
#
#	REJECT		The entire message is rejected.
#	REJECT text.... The text is sent to the originator.
#	IGNORE		The line is silently discarded.
#	WARN		The line is logged (not rejected) with a warning.
#
#	Substitution of sub-strings from the matched expression is
#	possible using the conventional perl syntax. The macros in the
#	replacement string may need to be protected with curly braces
#	if they aren't followed by whitespace (see the examples
#	below).
#
#	Lines starting with whitespace are continuation lines - they are
#	appended to the previous line (there should be no whitespace
#	before your regular expression!)
