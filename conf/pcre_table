# 
# NAME
#        pcre_table - format of Postfix PCRE tables
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        pcre:/etc/postfix/filename
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  Postfix  mail system uses optional tables for address
#        rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in dbm
#        or  db  format. Alternatively, lookup tables can be speci-
#        fied in Perl Compatible Regular Expression form.
# 
#        To find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix  sys-
#        tem supports use the postconf -m command.
# 
#        The general form of a PCRE table is:
# 
#        pattern result
#               When  pattern matches a search string, use the cor-
#               responding result.
# 
#        blank lines and comments
#               Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are  ignored,
#               as  are  lines whose first non-whitespace character
#               is a `#'.
# 
#        multi-line text
#               A logical line starts with non-whitespace  text.  A
#               line  that starts with whitespace continues a logi-
#               cal line.
# 
#        Each  pattern  is  a  perl-like  regular  expression.  The
#        expression  delimiter can be any character, except whites-
#        pace or characters that have special  meaning  (tradition-
#        ally  the  forward slash is used).  The regular expression
#        can contain whitespace.
# 
#        By default, matching is case-insensitive, although follow-
#        ing  the  second slash with an `i' flag will reverse this.
#        Other flags are supported, but the only other  useful  one
#        is `U', which makes matching ungreedy (see PCRE documenta-
#        tion and source for more info).
# 
#        Each pattern is applied to the entire lookup  key  string.
#        Depending  on  the  application,  that string is an entire
#        client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire
#        mail  address.   Thus,  no parent domain or parent network
#        search is done, and user@domain  mail  addresses  are  not
#        broken  up  into  their user and domain constituent parts,
#        nor is user+foo broken up into user and foo.
# 
#        Patterns are applied in the  order  as  specified  in  the
#        table,  until  a  pattern is found that matches the search
#        string.
# 
#        Substitution of substrings  from  the  matched  expression
#        into  the result string is possible using the conventional
#        perl syntax ($1, $2, etc.).   The  macros  in  the  result
#        string  may  need  to  be  written as ${n} or $(n) if they
#        aren't followed by whitespace.
# 
# EXAMPLE SMTPD ACCESS MAP
#        # Protect your outgoing majordomo exploders
#        /^(?!owner-)(.*)-outgoing@/     550 Use ${1}@${2} instead
# 
#        # Bounce friend@whatever, except when whatever is our domain (you would
#        # be better just bouncing all friend@ mail - this is just an example).
#        /^friend@(?!my\.domain)/        550 Stick this in your pipe $0
# 
#        # A multi-line entry. The text is sent as one line.
#        #
#        /^noddy@my\.domain$/
#         550 This user is a funny one. You really don't want to send mail to
#         them as it only makes their head spin.
# 
# EXAMPLE HEADER FILTER MAP
#        /^Subject: make money fast/     REJECT
#        /^To: friend@public\.com/       REJECT
