# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. EDIT THE MAIN.CF FILE INSTEAD. THE STUFF
# HERE JUST SERVES AS AN EXAMPLE.
#
# This file contains example settings of Postfix configuration parameters
# that control the SMTP server program.

#
# MISCELLANEOUS
#

# The disable_vrfy_command parameter allows you to disable the SMTP
# VRFY command. This stops some techniques used by spammers to harvest
# email addresses.
#
#disable_vrfy_command = no

# The smtpd_banner parameter specifies the text that follows the 220
# status code in the SMTP greeting banner. Some people like to see
# the mail version advertised. By default, Postfix shows no version.
#
# You MUST specify the $myhostname at the start of the text. When
# the SMTP client sees its own hostname at the start of an SMTP
# greeting banner it will report a mailer loop. That's better than
# having a machine meltdown.
#
# smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name ($mail_version)
smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name

# The smtpd_etrn_restrictions parameter restricts what clients are
# allowed to issue the ETRN command. The present Postfix ETRN differs
# from other ETRN implementations in that it flushes mail for all
# destinations. This will change in the future.
#
# The default is to allow ETRN from any host.  The following restrictions
# are available:
#
#   reject_unknown_client: reject the request if the client hostname is unknown.
#   permit_mynetworks: permit if the client address matches $mynetworks.
#   check_client_access maptype:mapname
#   maptype:mapname: look up client name, parent domains, client address,
#	or networks obtained by stripping octets.
#	Reject if result is REJECT or "[45]xx text"
#	Permit otherwise.
#   reject_maps_rbl: reject if the client is listed under $maps_rbl_domains.
#   reject: reject the request. Place this at the end of a restriction.
#   permit: permit the request. Place this at the end of a restriction.
smtpd_etrn_restrictions =

# The smtpd_recipient_limit parameter restricts the number of recipients
# that the SMTP server accepts per message delivery.
#
smtpd_recipient_limit = 1000

# The smtpd_timeout parameter limits the time in seconds to send an
# SMTP server response and to receive an SMTP client request.
#
# Note: if you set SMTP timeouts to large values you must update the
# global ipc_timeout parameter as well. See sample-misc.cf for details.
#
smtpd_timeout = 300

#
# TARPIT CONTROLS
#

# The smtpd_error_sleep_time parameter specifies the time in seconds
# the SMTP server waits before sending a 4xx or 5xx SMTP server error
# response. This prevents naive clients from going into an error -
# disconnect - connect - error loop.
#
smtpd_error_sleep_time = 5

# The smtpd_soft_error_limit parameter specifies an error count lower
# limit.  When an SMTP client has made this number of errors within
# a session, the server waits error_count seconds before responding
# to any client request.
#
smtpd_soft_error_limit = 10

# The smtpd_hard_error_limit parameter specifies an error count upper
# limit.  The SMTP server disconnects after an SMTP client makes this
# number of errors within a session.
#
smtpd_hard_error_limit = 100

#
# UCE RESTRICTIONS
#

# The smtpd_client_restrictions parameter specifies optional restrictions
# on SMTP client host names and addresses.

#   check_client_access maptype:mapname
#   maptype:mapname: look up client name, parent domains, client address,
#	or networks obtained by stripping octets.
#	Reject if result is REJECT or "[45]xx text"
#	Permit otherwise.
#   reject_maps_rbl: reject if the client is listed under $maps_rbl_domains.
#   reject: reject the request. Place this at the end of a restriction.
#   permit: permit the request. Place this at the end of a restriction.
#
# Restrictions are applied in the order as specified; the first
# restriction that matches wins.

# SMTP session.
#
# smtpd_helo_required = yes
smtpd_helo_required = no

# The smtpd_helo_restrictions parameter specifies optional restrictions
# on what SMTP clients can send in SMTP HELO and EHLO commands.

# The default is to permit everything.  The following restrictions
# are available:
#
#   permit_mynetworks: permit if the client address matches $mynetworks.
#   reject_unknown_client: reject the request if the client hostname is unknown.
#   reject_maps_rbl: reject if the client is listed under $maps_rbl_domains.

# The smtpd_recipient_restrictions parameter specifies restrictions on
# recipient addresses that SMTP clients can send in RCPT TO commands.
# 
# By default, Postfix relays mail
# - from trusted clients whose IP address matches $mynetworks,
# - from trusted clients matching $relay_domains or subdomains thereof,
# - from untrusted clients to destinations that match $relay_domains
#   or subdomains thereof, except addresses with sender-specified routing.
# The default relay_domains value is $mydestination.
#
# In addition to the above, the Postfix SMTP server by default accepts mail
# that Postfix is final destination for:
# - destinations that match $inet_interfaces,
# - destinations that match $mydestination
# - destinations that match $virtual_maps.
# These destinations do not need to be listed in $relay_domains.
# 
# The following restrictions are available (* is part of default setting):
#
#  *permit_mynetworks: permit if the client address matches $mynetworks.
#   reject_unknown_client: reject the request if the client hostname is unknown.
#   reject_maps_rbl: reject if the client is listed under $maps_rbl_domains.

#	- from trusted clients matching $relay_domains or subdomain thereof,
#	- from untrusted clients to destinations matching $relay_domains or
#	  subdomain thereof (except addresses with sender-specified routing),
#	Reject anything else.
#   permit_auth_destination: permit mail 
#	- to destinations matching $inet_interfaces, $mydestination,

#
# ADDITIONAL UCE CONTROLS
#

# The allow_untrusted_routing parameter controls if Postfix will
# forward mail with sender-specified routing (user[@%!]remote[@%!]site)
# from untrusted clients to destinations that are blessed by the
# relay_domains parameter.
# 
# By default, untrusted clients are not allowed to specify routing.
# This closes a nasty open relay loophole where a backup MX host can
# be tricked into forwarding junk mail to a primary MX host which
# then spams it out to the world.
#
allow_untrusted_routing = no

# The maps_rbl_domains parameter specifies an optional list of DNS
# domains that publish the network addresses of blacklisted hosts.
#
# By default, RBL blacklist lookups are disabled. See the
# smtpd_client_restrictions parameter.
#
# The real-time blackhole list works as follows: reverse the client
# network address, and reject service if it is listed below any of
# the following domains.
#
maps_rbl_domains = rbl.maps.vix.com

# The relay_domains parameter restricts what client hostname domains
# (and subdomains thereof) this mail system will relay mail from,
# and restricts what destination domains (and subdomains thereof)
# this system will relay mail to.
# 
# By default, Postfix relays mail
# - from trusted clients whose IP address matches $mynetworks, 
# - from trusted clients matching $relay_domains or subdomains thereof,
# - from untrusted clients to destinations that match $relay_domains
#   or subdomains thereof, except addresses with sender-specified routing.
# The default relay_domains value is $mydestination.  
# 
# In addition to the above, the Postfix SMTP server by default accepts mail 
# that Postfix is final destination for:
# - destinations that match $inet_interfaces, 
# - destinations that match $mydestination 
# - destinations that match $virtual_maps.
# These destinations do not need to be listed in $relay_domains.
#
# Specify a list of hosts or domains, /file/name patterns or type:name
# lookup tables, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue
# long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. A file name
# is replaced by its contents; a type:name table is matched when a
# (parent) domain appears as lookup key.
#
# NOTE: Postfix will not automatically forward mail for domains that
# list this system as their primary or backup MX host. See the
# permit_mx_backup restriction, in the description of the
# smtpd_recipient_restrictions parameter.
#
relay_domains = $mydestination

#
# RESPONSE CODES
