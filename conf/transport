# TRANSPORT(5)                                         TRANSPORT(5)
# 
# NAME
#        transport - format of Postfix transport table
# 
# SYNOPSIS
#        postmap /etc/postfix/transport
# 
# DESCRIPTION
#        The  optional  transport  table  specifies  a mapping from
#        domain hierarchies to message delivery  transports  and/or
#        relay hosts. The mapping is used by the trivial-rewrite(8)
#        daemon.
# 
#        Normally, the transport table is specified as a text  file
#        that  serves  as  input  to  the  postmap(1) command.  The
#        result, an indexed file in dbm or db format, is  used  for
#        fast  searching  by  the  mail system. Execute the command
#        postmap /etc/postfix/transport in  order  to  rebuild  the
#        indexed file after changing the transport table.
# 
#        When  the  table  is provided via other means such as NIS,
#        LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are  done  as  for  ordinary
#        indexed files.
# 
#        Alternatively,  the  table  can  be provided as a regular-
#        expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
#        sions.  In  that  case, the lookups are done in a slightly
#        different way as described below.
# 
# TABLE FORMAT
#        The format of the transport table is as follows:
# 
#        pattern result
#               When pattern matches the  domain,  use  the  corre-
#               sponding result.
# 
#        blank lines and comments
#               Empty  lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored,
#               as are lines whose first  non-whitespace  character
#               is a `#'.
# 
#        multi-line text
#               A  logical  line starts with non-whitespace text. A
#               line that starts with whitespace continues a  logi-
#               cal line.
# 
#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
#        networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or  SQL,  patterns  are
#        tried in the order as listed below:
# 
#        domain transport:nexthop
#               Mail  for  domain is delivered through transport to
#               nexthop.
# 
#        .domain transport:nexthop
#               Mail for  any  subdomain  of  domain  is  delivered
#               through  transport  to  nexthop.  This applies only
#               when the string transport_maps is not listed in the
#               parent_domain_matches_subdomains configuration set-
#               ting.  Otherwise, a domain name matches itself  and
#               its subdomains.
# 
#        Note:  transport  map entries take precedence over domains
#        specified in the mydestination parameter. If you  use  the
#        optional  transport  map,  it  may  be  safer  to  specify
#        explicit entries for all domains specified  in  mydestina-
#        tion, for example:
# 
#             hostname.my.domain   local:
#             localhost.my.domain      local:
# 
#        The  interpretation  of  the  nexthop  field  is transport
#        dependent. In the case of SMTP, specify host:service for a
#        non-default  server port, and use [host] or [host]:port in
#        order to disable MX (mail exchanger) DNS lookups.  The  []
#        form  can  also be used with IP addresses instead of host-
#        names.
# 
# EXAMPLES
#        In order to send mail for foo.org and its  subdomains  via
#        the uucp transport to the UUCP host named foo:
# 
#             foo.org      uucp:foo
#             .foo.org     uucp:foo
# 
#        When  no  nexthop  host name is specified, the destination
#        domain name is used instead. For  example,  the  following
#        directs  mail for user@foo.org via the slow transport to a
#        mail exchanger for foo.org.  The slow transport  could  be
#        something  that  runs  at  most  one delivery process at a
#        time:
# 
#             foo.org      slow:
# 
#        When no transport is specified, the default  transport  is
#        used, as specified via the default_transport configuration
#        parameter. The following sends all mail  for  foo.org  and
#        its subdomains to host gateway.foo.org:
# 
#             foo.org      :[gateway.foo.org]
#             .foo.org     :[gateway.foo.org]
# 
#        In  the  above  example,  the  []  are used to suppress MX
#        lookups.  The result would  likely  point  to  your  local
#        machine.
# 
#        In  the  case  of delivery via SMTP, one may specify host-
#        name:service instead of just a host:
# 
#             foo.org      smtp:bar.org:2025
# 
#        This directs mail for user@foo.org to  host  bar.org  port
#        2025.  Instead  of a numerical port a symbolic name may be
#        used. Specify [] around the hostname in order  to  disable
#        MX lookups.
# 
#        The error mailer can be used to bounce mail:
# 
#             .foo.org       error:mail for *.foo.org is not deliv-
#        erable
# 
#        This causes  all  mail  for  user@anything.foo.org  to  be
#        bounced.
# 
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
#        This  section  describes how the table lookups change when
#        the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
#        a  description  of regular expression lookup table syntax,
#        see regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5).
# 
#        Each pattern is a regular expression that  is  applied  to
#        the entire domain being looked up. Thus, some.domain.hier-
#        archy is not broken up into parent domains.
# 
#        Patterns are applied in the  order  as  specified  in  the
#        table,  until  a  pattern is found that matches the search
#        string.
# 
#        Results are the same as with indexed  file  lookups,  with
#        the  additional feature that parenthesized substrings from
#        the pattern can be interpolated as $1, $2 and so on.
# 
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
#        The following main.cf parameters are  especially  relevant
#        to  this  topic.  See  the Postfix main.cf file for syntax
#        details and for default values.  Use  the  postfix  reload
#        command after a configuration change.
# 
#        parent_domain_matches_subdomains
#               List  of Postfix features that use domain.name pat-
#               terns  to  match  sub.domain.name  (as  opposed  to
#               requiring .domain.name patterns).
# 
#        transport_maps
#               List of transport lookup tables.
# 
#        Other parameters of interest:
# 
#        default_transport
#               The  transport  to use when no transport is explic-
#               itly specified.
# 
#        relayhost
#               The default host to send to when no transport table
#               entry matches.
