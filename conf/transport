# NAME
#	transport 5
# SUMMARY
#	format of Postfix transport table
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/transport\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The optional \fBtransport\fR file specifies a mapping from domain
#	hierarchies to message delivery transports and/or relay hosts. The
#	mapping is used by the \fBtrivial-rewrite\fR(8) daemon.
#
#	The file serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command. The result,
#	an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format, is used for
#	fast searching by the mail system. After updating this table,
#	issue the \fBpostfix reload\fR command to make the change visible.
#
#	The format of the transport table is as follows:
# .IP "blanks and comments"
#	Blank lines are ignored, as are lines beginning with `#'.
# .IP "\fIdomain transport\fR:\fInexthop\fR"
#	Mail for \fIdomain\fR is delivered through \fItransport\fR to
#	\fInexthop\fR.
# .IP "\fI.domain transport\fR:\fInexthop\fR"
#	Mail for any subdomain of \fIdomain\fR is delivered through
#	\fItransport\fR to \fInexthop\fR.
# .PP
#	Note: transport map entries take precedence over domains
#	specified in the \fBmydestination\fR parameter. If you use
#	the optional transport map, it may be safer to specify explicit
#	entries for all domains specified in \fBmydestination\fR,
#	for example:
#
# .ti +5
#	\fBhostname.my.domain       local:\fR
# .ti +5
#	\fBlocalhost.my.domain      local:\fR
#
#	The interpretation of the \fInexthop\fR field is transport
#	dependent. In the case of SMTP, specify \fIhost\fR:\fIservice\fR for a
#	non-default server port, and use [\fIhost\fR] or [\fIhost\fR:\fIport\fR]
#	in order to disable MX (mail exchanger) DNS lookups. The [] form
#	can also be used with IP addresses instead of hostnames.
# EXAMPLES
# .ad
#	In order to send mail for \fBfoo.org\fR and its subdomains
#	via the \fBuucp\fR transport to the UUCP host named \fBfoo\fR:
#
# .ti +5
#	\fBfoo.org      uucp:foo\fR
# .ti +5
#	\fB\&.foo.org     uucp:foo\fR
#
#	When no \fInexthop\fR host name is specified, the destination domain
#	name is used instead. For example, the following directs mail for
#	\fIuser\fR@\fBfoo.org\fR via the \fBslow\fR transport to a mail
#	exchanger for \fBfoo.org\fR.  The \fBslow\fR transport could be
#	something that runs at most one delivery process at a time:
#
# .ti +5
#	\fBfoo.org      slow:\fR
#
#	When no \fItransport\fR is specified, the default transport is
#	used, as specified via the \fBdefault_transport\fR configuration
#	parameter. The following sends all mail for \fBfoo.org\fR and its
#	subdomains to host \fBgateway.foo.org\fR:
#
# .ti +5
#	\fBfoo.org      :[gateway.foo.org]\fR
# .ti +5
#	\fB\&.foo.org     :[gateway.foo.org]\fR
#
#	In the above example, the [] are used to suppress MX lookups.
#	The result would likely point to your local machine.
#
#	In the case of delivery via SMTP, one may specify
#	\fIhostname\fR:\fIservice\fR instead of just a host:
#
# .ti +5
#	\fBfoo.org      smtp:bar.org:2025\fR
#
#	This directs mail for \fIuser\fR@\fBfoo.org\fR to host \fBbar.org\fR
#	port \fB2025\fR. Instead of a numerical port a symbolic name may be
#	used. Specify [] around the destination in order to disable MX lookups.
#
#	The error mailer can be used to bounce mail:
#
# .ti +5
#	\fB\&.foo.org      error:mail for *.foo.org is not deliverable\fR
#
#	This causes all mail for \fIuser\fR@\fIanything\fBfoo.org\fR 
#	to be bounced.
