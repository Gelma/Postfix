LINUX PORTABILITY
=================

On RedHat Linux 7.0, you must install the db3-devel RPM before you
can compile the Postfix source code.

LINUX SYSLOGD PERFORMANCE
=========================

LINUX syslogd uses synchronous writes by default, which is very
expensive. For services such as mail it is recommended that you
disable synchronous logfile writes by editing /etc/syslog.conf and
by prepending a - to the logfile name:

    mail.*                          -/var/log/mail.log

Send a "kill -HUP" to the syslogd to make the change effective.
