CANONICAL(5)                                         CANONICAL(5)

<b>NAME</b>
       canonical - format of Postfix canonical table

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postmap /etc/postfix/canonical</b>

       <b>postmap -q "</b><i>string</i><b>" /etc/postfix/canonical</b>

       <b>postmap -q - /etc/postfix/canonical</b> &lt;<i>inputfile</i>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  optional <b>canonical</b> table specifies an address mapping
       for local and non-local addresses. The mapping is used  by
       the  <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> daemon.  The address mapping is recursive.

       Normally, the <b>canonical</b> table is specified as a text  file
       that  serves  as  input  to  the  <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a> command.  The
       result, an indexed file in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format, is  used  for
       fast  searching  by  the  mail system. Execute the command
       <b>postmap /etc/postfix/canonical</b> in  order  to  rebuild  the
       indexed file after changing the text file.

       When  the  table  is provided via other means such as NIS,
       LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are  done  as  for  ordinary
       indexed files.

       Alternatively,  the  table  can  be provided as a regular-
       expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
       sions,  or lookups can be directed to TCP-based server. In
       that case, the lookups are done in  a  slightly  different
       way  as  described below under "REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES"
       and "TCP-BASED TABLES".

       The  <b>canonical</b>  mapping  affects   both   message   header
       addresses (i.e. addresses that appear inside messages) and
       message envelope addresses  (for  example,  the  addresses
       that  are  used in SMTP protocol commands). Think Sendmail
       rule set <b>S3</b>, if you like.

       Typically, one would use the <b>canonical</b>  table  to  replace
       login   names   by  <i>Firstname.Lastname</i>,  or  to  clean  up
       addresses produced by legacy mail systems.

       The <b>canonical</b> mapping is not to be confused  with  <i>virtual</i>
       <i>domain</i> support. Use the <a href="virtual.5.html"><b>virtual</b>(5)</a> map for that purpose.

       The  <b>canonical</b>  mapping  is  not to be confused with local
       aliasing.  Use the <a href="aliases.5.html"><b>aliases</b>(5)</a> map for that purpose.

<b>TABLE FORMAT</b>
       The input format for the <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a> command is as follows:

       <i>pattern result</i>
              When  <i>pattern</i> matches a mail address, replace it by
              the corresponding <i>result</i>.

       blank lines and comments
              Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are  ignored,
              as  are  lines whose first non-whitespace character
              is a `#'.

       multi-line text
              A logical line starts with non-whitespace  text.  A
              line  that starts with whitespace continues a logi-
              cal line.

       With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
       networked  tables  such  as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are
       tried in the order as listed below:

       <i>user</i>@<i>domain address</i>
              <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i> is replaced by <i>address</i>. This  form  has
              the highest precedence.

              This  is  useful  to clean up addresses produced by
              legacy mail systems.  It can also be used  to  pro-
              duce  <i>Firstname.Lastname</i>  style  addresses, but see
              below for a simpler solution.

       <i>user address</i>
              <i>user</i>@<i>site</i> is replaced by <i>address</i> when <i>site</i> is equal
              to  $<b><a href="postconf.5.html#myorigin">myorigin</a></b>,  when  <i>site</i> is listed in $<b><a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">mydestina</a>-</b>
              <b><a href="postconf.5.html#mydestination">tion</a></b>, or when it is listed in  $<b><a href="postconf.5.html#inet_interfaces">inet_interfaces</a></b>  or
              $<b><a href="postconf.5.html#proxy_interfaces">proxy_interfaces</a></b>.

              This  form  is  useful for replacing login names by
              <i>Firstname.Lastname</i>.

       @<i>domain address</i>
              Every address in <i>domain</i>  is  replaced  by  <i>address</i>.
              This form has the lowest precedence.

       In  all the above forms, when <i>address</i> has the form @<i>other-</i>
       <i>domain</i>, the result is the same user in <i>otherdomain</i>.

<b>ADDRESS EXTENSION</b>
       When a mail address localpart contains the optional recip-
       ient  delimiter  (e.g., <i>user+foo</i>@<i>domain</i>), the lookup order
       becomes: <i>user+foo</i>@<i>domain</i>, <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>, <i>user+foo</i>, <i>user</i>, and
       @<i>domain</i>.

       The   <b><a href="postconf.5.html#propagate_unmatched_extensions">propagate_unmatched_extensions</a></b>   parameter  controls
       whether an unmatched address extension  (<i>+foo</i>)  is  propa-
       gated to the result of table lookup.

<b>REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES</b>
       This  section  describes how the table lookups change when
       the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
       a  description  of regular expression lookup table syntax,
       see <a href="regexp_table.5.html"><b>regexp_table</b>(5)</a> or <a href="pcre_table.5.html"><b>pcre_table</b>(5)</a>.

       Each pattern is a regular expression that  is  applied  to
       the entire address being looked up. Thus, <i>user@domain</i> mail
       addresses are not broken up into their  <i>user</i>  and  <i>@domain</i>
       constituent parts, nor is <i>user+foo</i> broken up into <i>user</i> and
       <i>foo</i>.

       Patterns are applied in the  order  as  specified  in  the
       table,  until  a  pattern is found that matches the search
       string.

       Results are the same as with indexed  file  lookups,  with
       the  additional feature that parenthesized substrings from
       the pattern can be interpolated as <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b> and so on.

<b>TCP-BASED TABLES</b>
       This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
       lookups are directed to a TCP-based server. For a descrip-
       tion  of  the  TCP  client/server  lookup  protocol,   see
       <b>tcp_table</b>(5).   This  feature  is not available in Postfix
       version 2.1.

       Each lookup operation uses the entire address once.  Thus,
       <i>user@domain</i>  mail  addresses  are not broken up into their
       <i>user</i> and <i>@domain</i> constituent parts, nor is <i>user+foo</i> broken
       up into <i>user</i> and <i>foo</i>.

       Results are the same as with indexed file lookups.

<b>BUGS</b>
       The  table format does not understand quoting conventions.
