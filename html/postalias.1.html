POSTALIAS(1)                                         POSTALIAS(1)

<b>NAME</b>
       postalias - Postfix alias database maintenance

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postalias</b> [<b>-Nfinrvw</b>] [<b>-c</b> <i>config_dir</i>] [<b>-d</b> <i>key</i>] [<b>-q</b> <i>key</i>]
       [<i>file_type</i>:]<i>file_name</i> ...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The <b>postalias</b> command creates or queries one or more Post-
       fix alias databases, or updates an existing one. The input
       and output file formats are expected to be compatible with
       Sendmail  version  8,  and are expected to be suitable for
       the use as NIS alias maps.

       While a database update is in progress, signal delivery is
       postponed,  and  an exclusive, advisory, lock is placed on
       the entire database, in order to avoid surprises in  spec-
       tator programs.

       Options:

       <b>-N</b>     Include  the terminating null character that termi-
              nates lookup keys and values. By  default,  Postfix
              does whatever is the default for the host operating
              system.

       <b>-c</b> <i>config_dir</i>
              Read the <b>main.cf</b> configuration file  in  the  named
              directory  instead  of  the  default  configuration
              directory.

       <b>-d</b> <i>key</i> Search the specified maps for <i>key</i>  and  remove  one
              entry  per  map.   The exit status is zero when the
              requested information was found.

              If a key value of <b>-</b> is specified, the program reads
              key values from the standard input stream. The exit
              status is zero when at least one of  the  requested
              keys was found.

       <b>-f</b>     Do not fold the lookup key to lower case while cre-
              ating or querying a map.

       <b>-i</b>     Incremental mode. Read entries from standard  input
              and  do  not  truncate  an  existing  database.  By
              default, <b>postalias</b> creates a new database from  the
              entries in <b>file</b><i>_</i><b>name</b>.

       <b>-n</b>     Don't  include  the terminating null character that
              terminates lookup  keys  and  values.  By  default,
              Postfix  does  whatever is the default for the host
              operating system.

       <b>-q</b> <i>key</i> Search the specified maps for  <i>key</i>  and  print  the
              first  value  found  on the standard output stream.
              The exit status is zero when the requested informa-
              tion was found.

              If a key value of <b>-</b> is specified, the program reads
              key values  from  the  standard  input  stream  and
              prints  one  line of <i>key:</i> <i>value</i> output for each key
              that was found. The exit status  is  zero  when  at
              least one of the requested keys was found.

       <b>-r</b>     When  updating a table, do not warn about duplicate
              entries; silently replace them.

       <b>-v</b>     Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes. Mul-
              tiple  <b>-v</b>  options  make  the software increasingly
              verbose.

       <b>-w</b>     When updating a table, do not warn about  duplicate
              entries; silently ignore them.

       Arguments:

       <i>file_type</i>
              The type of database to be produced.

              <b>btree</b>  The   output   is   a   btree   file,  named
                     <i>file_name</i><b>.db</b>.  This  is  available  only  on
                     systems with support for <b>db</b> databases.

              <b>dbm</b>    The  output  consists  of  two  files, named
                     <i>file_name</i><b>.pag</b> and  <i>file_name</i><b>.dir</b>.   This  is
                     available  only  on systems with support for
                     <b>dbm</b> databases.

              <b>hash</b>   The  output  is   a   hashed   file,   named
                     <i>file_name</i><b>.db</b>.   This  is  available  only on
                     systems with support for <b>db</b> databases.

              When no <i>file_type</i> is specified, the  software  uses
              the  database  type specified via the <b>database</b><i>_</i><b>type</b>
              configuration parameter.   The  default  value  for
              this parameter depends on the host environment.

       <i>file_name</i>
              The  name  of  the  alias database source file when
              rebuilding a database.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems are logged to the standard error stream. No  out-
       put means no problems were detected. Duplicate entries are
       skipped and are flagged with a warning.

       <b>postalias</b> terminates with zero exit status in case of suc-
       cess  (including  successful <b>postmap</b> <b>-q</b> lookup) and termi-
       nates with non-zero exit status in case of failure.

<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>
       <b>MAIL</b><i>_</i><b>CONFIG</b>
              Directory with Postfix configuration files.

       <b>MAIL</b><i>_</i><b>VERBOSE</b>
              Enable verbose logging for debugging purposes.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The following <b>main.cf</b> parameters are  especially  relevant
       to  this  program. See the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file for syntax
       details and for default values.

       <b>database</b><i>_</i><b>type</b>
              Default alias database type. On many UNIX  systems,
              the default type is either <b>dbm</b> or <b>hash</b>.
