RELOCATED(5)                                         RELOCATED(5)


<b>NAME</b>
       relocated - format of Postfix relocated table

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/relocated</b>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The optional <b>relocated</b> table provides the information that
       is used in "user has moved to  <i>new_location</i>"  bounce  mes-
       sages.

       Normally,  the <b>relocated</b> table is specified as a text file
       that serves as  input  to  the  <a href="postmap.1.html"><b>postmap</b>(1)</a>  command.   The
       result,  an  indexed file in <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b> format, is used for
       fast searching by the mail  system.  Execute  the  command
       <b>postmap</b>  <b>/etc/postfix/relocated</b>  in  order  to rebuild the
       indexed file after changing the relocated table.

       When the table is provided via other means  such  as  NIS,
       LDAP  or  SQL,  the  same lookups are done as for ordinary
       indexed files.

       Alternatively, the table can be  provided  as  a  regular-
       expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-
       sions. In that case, the lookups are done  in  a  slightly
       different way as described below.

       Table lookups are case insensitive.

<b>TABLE</b> <b>FORMAT</b>
       The format of the table is as follows:

       <b>o</b>      Blank  lines  are  ignored,  as are lines beginning
              with `#'.

       <b>o</b>      Lines that begin with whitespace continue the  pre-
              vious line.

       <b>o</b>      An entry has one of the following form:
                   <i>key</i>  <i>new_location</i>
              Where  <i>new_location</i>  specifies  contact information
              such as an  email  address,  or  perhaps  a  street
              address or telephone number.

       With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from
       networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the  <i>key</i>  field
       is one of the following:

       <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>
              Matches  <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>. This form has precedence over
              all other forms.

       <i>user</i>   Matches <i>user</i>@<i>site</i> when <i>site</i> is $<b>myorigin</b>, when <i>site</i>
              is listed in $<b>mydestination</b>, or when <i>site</i> is listed



                                                                1





RELOCATED(5)                                         RELOCATED(5)


              in $<b>inet</b><i>_</i><b>interfaces</b>.

       @<i>domain</i>
              Matches every address in <i>domain</i>. This form has  the
              lowest precedence.

<b>ADDRESS</b> <b>EXTENSION</b>
       When  the search fails, and the address localpart contains
       the optional recipient delimiter (e.g.,  <i>user+foo</i>@<i>domain</i>),
       the  search  is  repeated for the unextended address (e.g.
       <i>user</i>@<i>domain</i>).

<b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>TABLES</b>
       This section describes how the table lookups  change  when
       the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For
       a description of regular expression lookup  table  syntax,
       see <a href="regexp_table.5.html"><b>regexp</b><i>_</i><b>table</b>(5)</a> or <a href="pcre_table.5.html"><b>pcre</b><i>_</i><b>table</b>(5)</a>.

       Each  pattern  is  a regular expression that is applied to
       the entire address being looked up. Thus, <i>user@domain</i> mail
       addresses  are  not  broken up into their <i>user</i> and <i>@domain</i>
       constituent parts, nor is <i>user+foo</i> broken up into <i>user</i> and
       <i>foo</i>.

       Patterns  are  applied  in  the  order as specified in the
       table, until a pattern is found that  matches  the  search
       string.

       Results  are the same as with normal indexed file lookups,
       with the additional feature that parenthesized  substrings
       from  the pattern can be interpolated as <b>$1</b>, <b>$2</b> and so on.

<b>BUGS</b>
       The table format does not understand quoting  conventions.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The  following  <b>main.cf</b> parameters are especially relevant
       to this topic. See the Postfix  <b>main.cf</b>  file  for  syntax
       details  and  for  default  values. Use the <b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>
       command after a configuration change.
