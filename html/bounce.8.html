BOUNCE(8)                                               BOUNCE(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       bounce - Postfix message bounce or defer daemon

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>bounce</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>bounce</b>  daemon  maintains  per-message log files with
       non-delivery status information. Each log  file  is  named
       after  the  queue file that it corresponds to, and is kept
       in a queue subdirectory named after the  service  name  in
       the <b>master.cf</b> file (either <b>bounce</b> or <b>defer</b>).  This program
       expects to be run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a> process manager.

       The <b>bounce</b> daemon processes two types of service requests:

       <b>o</b>      Append  a  recipient status record to a per-message
              log file.

       <b>o</b>      Post a bounce message, with a copy of  a  log  file
              and  of  the corresponding message. When the bounce
              is posted successfully, the log file is deleted.

       The software does a best effort to notify the sender  that
       there  was a problem. A notification is sent even when the
       log file or original message cannot be read.

       Optionally, a client can request that the per-message  log
       file  be deleted when the requested operation fails.  This
       is used by clients that cannot retry transactions by them-
       selves,  and  that  depend  on  retry  logic  in their own
       client.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html">RFC 822</a> (ARPA Internet Text Messages)
       <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1894.html">RFC 1894</a> (Delivery Status Notifications)
       <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2045.html">RFC 2045</a> (Format of Internet Message Bodies)

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       The log files use an  ad-hoc,  unstructured  format.  This
       will  have  to  change in order to easily support standard
       delivery status notifications.
