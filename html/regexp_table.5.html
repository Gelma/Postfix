REGEXP_TABLE(5)                                   REGEXP_TABLE(5)

<b>NAME</b>
       regexp_table - format of Postfix regular expression tables

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>regexp:/etc/postfix/</b><i>filename</i>

       <b>postmap</b> <b>-q</b> <b>"</b><i>string</i><b>"</b> <b>regexp:/etc/postfix/</b><i>filename</i>

       <b>postmap</b> <b>-q</b> <b>-</b> <b>regexp:/etc/postfix/</b><i>filename</i> &lt;<i>inputfile</i>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The Postfix mail system uses optional tables  for  address
       rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in <b>dbm</b>
       or <b>db</b> format. Alternatively, lookup tables can  be  speci-
       fied in POSIX regular expression form.

       To  find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix sys-
       tem supports use the <b>postconf</b> <b>-m</b> command.

       To  test  lookup  tables,  use  the  <b>postmap</b>  command   as
       described in the SYNOPSIS above.

       The general form of a Postfix regular expression table is:

       <b>/</b><i>pattern</i><b>/</b><i>flags</i> <i>result</i>

       <b>!/</b><i>pattern</i><b>/</b><i>flags</i> <i>result</i>
              When <i>pattern</i> matches  (does  not  match)  a  search
              string, use the corresponding <i>result</i> value.

       blank lines and comments
              Empty  lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored,
              as are lines whose first  non-whitespace  character
              is a `#'.

       multi-line text
              A  logical  line starts with non-whitespace text. A
              line that starts with whitespace continues a  logi-
              cal line.

       <b>if</b> <b>/</b><i>pattern</i><b>/</b><i>flags</i>

       <b>if</b> <b>!/</b><i>pattern</i><b>/</b><i>flags</i>

       <b>endif</b>  Examine the lines between <b>if</b>..<b>endif</b> only if <i>pattern</i>
              matches (does not match). The <b>if</b>..<b>endif</b>  can  nest.
              Do   not  prepend  whitespace  to  patterns  inside
              <b>if</b>..<b>endif</b>.

       Each pattern is a regular expression enclosed by a pair of
       delimiters.  The regular expression syntax is described in
       <i>re_format</i>(7).  The expression delimiter can be any charac-
       ter,  except  whitespace  or  characters that have special
       meaning (traditionally the forward  slash  is  used).  The
       regular expression can contain whitespace.

       By default, matching is case-insensitive, although follow-
       ing the second slash with an `i' flag will  reverse  this.
       Other  flags are `x' (disable extended expression syntax),
       and `m' (enable multi-line mode, that  is,  treat  newline
       characters as special).

       Each  pattern  is applied to the entire lookup key string.
       Depending on the application, that  string  is  an  entire
       client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire
       mail address.  Thus, no parent domain  or  parent  network
       search  is  done,  and  <i>user@domain</i> mail addresses are not
       broken up into their <i>user</i> and  <i>domain</i>  constituent  parts,
       nor is <i>user+foo</i> broken up into <i>user</i> and <i>foo</i>.

       Patterns  are  applied  in  the  order as specified in the
       table, until a pattern is found that  matches  the  search
       string.

       Substitution  of  substrings  from  the matched expression
       into the result string is possible using $1, $2, etc.. The
       macros in the result string may need to be written as ${n}
       or $(n) if they aren't followed by whitespace.

<b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>SMTPD</b> <b>ACCESS</b> <b>MAP</b>
       # Disallow sender-specified routing. This is a must if you relay mail
       # for other domains.
       /[%!@].*[%!@]/       550 Sender-specified routing rejected

       # Postmaster is OK, that way they can talk to us about how to fix
       # their problem.
       /^postmaster@/       OK

       # Protect your outgoing majordomo exploders
       if !/^owner-/
       /^(.*)-outgoing@(.*)$/   550 Use ${1}@${2} instead
       endif

<b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>HEADER</b> <b>FILTER</b> <b>MAP</b>
       # These were once common in junk mail.
       /^Subject: make money fast/     REJECT
       /^To: friend@public\.com/       REJECT

<b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>BODY</b> <b>FILTER</b> <b>MAP</b>
       # First skip over base 64 encoded text to save CPU cycles.
       ~^[[:alnum:]+/]{60,}$~          OK

       # Put your own body patterns here.
