REGEXP_TABLE(5)                                   REGEXP_TABLE(5)

<b>NAME</b>
       regexp_table - format of Postfix regular expression tables

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       regexp:/etc/postfix/filename

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The Postfix mail system uses optional tables  for  address
       rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in <b>dbm</b>
       or <b>db</b> format. Alternatively, lookup tables can  be  speci-
       fied in POSIX regular expression form.

       To  find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix sys-
       tem supports use the <b>postconf</b> <b>-m</b> command.

       The general form of a Postfix regular expression table is:

       <i>pattern</i> <i>result</i>
              When  <i>pattern</i> matches a search string, use the cor-
              responding <i>result</i>.

       blank lines and comments
              Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are  ignored,
              as  are  lines whose first non-whitespace character
              is a `#'.

       multi-line text
              A logical line starts with non-whitespace  text.  A
              line  that starts with whitespace continues a logi-
              cal line.

       <i>pattern1!pattern2</i> <i>result</i>
              Matches <i>pattern1</i> but not <i>pattern2</i>.

       Each pattern is a regular expression enclosed by a pair of
       delimiters.  The regular expression syntax is described in
       <i>re_format</i>(7).  The expression delimiter can be any charac-
       ter,  except  whitespace  or  characters that have special
       meaning (traditionally the forward  slash  is  used).  The
       regular expression can contain whitespace.

       By default, matching is case-insensitive, although follow-
       ing the second slash with an `i' flag will  reverse  this.
       Other  flags are `x' (disable extended expression syntax),
       and `m' (enable multi-line mode).

       Each pattern is applied to the entire lookup  key  string.
       Depending  on  the  application,  that string is an entire
       client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire
       mail  address.   Thus,  no parent domain or parent network
       search is done, and <i>user@domain</i>  mail  addresses  are  not
       broken  up  into  their <i>user</i> and <i>domain</i> constituent parts,
       nor is <i>user+foo</i> broken up into <i>user</i> and <i>foo</i>.

       Patterns are applied in the  order  as  specified  in  the
       table,  until  a  pattern is found that matches the search
       string.

       Substitution of substrings  from  the  matched  expression
       into the result string is possible using $1, $2, etc.. The
       macros in the result string may need to be written as ${n}
       or $(n) if they aren't followed by whitespace.

<b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>SMTPD</b> <b>ACCESS</b> <b>MAP</b>
       # Disallow sender-specified routing. This is a must if you relay mail
       # for other domains.
       /[%!@].*[%!@]/       550 Sender-specified routing rejected

       # Postmaster is OK, that way they can talk to us about how to fix
       # their problem.
       /^postmaster@/       OK

       # Protect your outgoing majordomo exploders
       /^(.*)-outgoing@(.*)$/!/^owner-/         550 Use ${1}@${2} instead

<b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>HEADER</b> <b>FILTER</b> <b>MAP</b>
       # These were once common in junk mail.
       /^Subject: make money fast/     REJECT
       /^To: friend@public\.com/       REJECT
