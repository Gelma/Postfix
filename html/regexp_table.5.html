REGEXP_TABLE(5)                                   REGEXP_TABLE(5)


<b>NAME</b>
       regexp_table - format of Postfix regular expression tables

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       regexp:/etc/postfix/filename

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The Postfix mail system uses optional tables  for  address
       rewriting or mail routing. These tables are usually in <b>dbm</b>
       or <b>db</b> format. Alternatively, lookup tables can  be  speci-
       fied in POSIX regular expression form.

       To  find out what types of lookup tables your Postfix sys-
       tem supports use the <b>postconf</b> <b>-m</b> command.

       The general form of a Postfix regular expression table is:

       blanks and comments
              Blank  lines  are  ignored,  as are lines beginning
              with `#'.

       leading whitespace
              Lines that begin with whitespace continue the  pre-
              vious line.

       <i>pattern</i> <i>result</i>
              When  <i>pattern</i> matches a search string, use the cor-
              responding <i>result</i>. A line that  starts  with  white
              space continues the preceding line.

       <i>pattern1!pattern2</i> <i>result</i>
              Matches <i>pattern1</i> but not <i>pattern2</i>.

       Each pattern is a regular expression enclosed by a pair of
       delimiters.  The regular expression syntax is described in
       <i>re_format</i>(7).  The expression delimiter can be any charac-
       ter, except whitespace or  characters  that  have  special
       meaning  (traditionally  the  forward  slash is used). The
       regular expression can contain whitespace.

       By default, matching is case-insensitive, although follow-
       ing  the  second slash with an `i' flag will reverse this.
       Other flags are `x' (disable extended expression  syntax),
       and `m' (enable multi-line mode).

       Each  pattern  is applied to the entire lookup key string.
       Depending on the application, that  string  is  an  entire
       client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an entire
       mail address.  Thus, no parent domain  or  parent  network
       search  is  done,  and  <i>user@domain</i> mail addresses are not
       broken up into their <i>user</i> and  <i>domain</i>  constituent  parts,
       nor is <i>user+foo</i> broken up into <i>user</i> and <i>foo</i>.

       Patterns  are  applied  in  the  order as specified in the



                                                                1

       table, until a pattern is found that  matches  the  search
       string.

       Substitution  of  substrings  from  the matched expression
       into the result string is possible using $1, $2, etc.. The
       macros in the result string may need to be written as ${n}
       or $(n) if they aren't followed by whitespace.

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
       # Disallow sender-specified routing. This is a must if you relay mail
       # for other domains.
       /[%!@].*[%!@]/            550 Sender-specified routing rejected

       # Postmaster is OK, that way they can talk to us about how to fix
       # their problem.
       /^postmaster@.*$/         OK

       # Protect your outgoing majordomo exploders
       /^(.*)-outgoing@(.*)$/!/^owner-.*/      550 Use ${1}@${2} instead
