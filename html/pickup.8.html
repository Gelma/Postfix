PICKUP(8)                                               PICKUP(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       pickup - Postfix local mail pickup

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>pickup</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>pickup</b>  daemon waits for hints that new mail has been
       dropped into the <b>maildrop</b> directory, and feeds it into the
       <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a>  daemon.  Ill-formatted files are deleted with-
       out notifying the originator.  This program expects to  be
       run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a> process manager.

<b>STANDARDS</b>
       None. The <b>pickup</b> daemon does not interact with the outside
       world.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The <b>pickup</b> daemon runs with superuser privileges  so  that
       it 1) can open a queue file with the rights of the submit-
       ting user and 2) can access the Postfix private IPC  chan-
       nels.  On the positive side, the program can run chrooted,
       opens no files for writing, is careful about what files it
       opens  for  reading,  and does not actually touch any data
       that is sent to its public service endpoint.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       The <b>pickup</b> daemon copies mail from file to the  <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a>
       daemon.   It could avoid message copying overhead by send-
       ing a file descriptor instead of file data, but  then  the
       already  complex <a href="cleanup.8.html"><b>cleanup</b>(8)</a> daemon would have to deal with
       unfiltered user data.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The following <b>main.cf</b> parameters are  especially  relevant
       to  this  program. See the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file for syntax
       details and for default values.  Use  the  <b>postfix</b>  <b>reload</b>
       command after a configuration change.

<b>Content</b> <b>inspection</b> <b>controls</b>

              same syntax as the right-hand  side  of  a  Postfix
              transport table.

<b>Miscellaneous</b>
