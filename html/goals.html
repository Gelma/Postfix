<h2>Primary goals</h2>

The goal of the Postfix project is to implement a viable alternative
to the UNIX Sendmail program.  Specific goals, and the ways that
Postfix attempts to achieve them are:

<ul>

<li>Wide dissemination. Postfix must be adopted by lots of people
in order to make a significant impact on Internet mail performance
and security. Therefore the software is given away for free, with
no strings attached to it.

<p>

<li>Performance. Postfix is up to three times as fast as its nearest
competitor.  A desktop PC running Postfix can receive and deliver
a million <i>different</i> messages per day. Postfix uses web server
tricks to reduce process creation overhead and uses other tricks
to reduce file system overhead, without compromising reliability.

<p>

<li>Compatibility. Postfix is designed to be sendmail-compatible
to make migration easy.  Postfix supports <b>/var[/spool]/mail</b>,
<b>/etc/aliases</b>, <b>NIS</b>, and <b>~/.forward</b> files.
However, Postfix also attempts to be easy to administer, and
therefore it does <i>not</i> use <b>sendmail.cf</b>.

<p>

<li>Safety and robustness.  Postfix is designed to behave rationally
under stress.  When the local system runs out of disk space or
memory, the Postfix software backs off, instead of making the
problem worse. By design, no Postfix program keeps growing as the
number of messages etc. increases. Postfix is designed to stay in
control.

<p>

<li>Flexibility. Postfix is built from over a dozen little programs
that each perform only one specific task: receive a message via
SMTP, deliver a message via SMTP, deliver a message locally, rewrite
an address, and so on.  Sites with specific requirements can replace
one or more little programs by alternative versions. And it is easy
to disable functionality, too: firewalls and client workstations
don't need local delivery at all.

<p>

<li>Security. Postfix uses multiple layers of defense to protect
the local system against intruders. Almost every Postfix daemon
can run in a <i>chroot</i> jail with fixed low privileges. There
is no direct path from the network to the security-sensitive local
delivery programs - an intruder has to break through several other
programs first. Postfix does not even trust the contents of its
own queue files, or the contents of its own IPC messages. Postfix
filters sender-provided information before exporting it via
environment variables.  Last but not least, no Postfix program is
<i>set-uid</i>.

</ul>

<h2>Other significant features of interest</h2>

<ul>

<li><a href="rewrite.html#transport">Multiple transports</a>.  In
the past the author has configured Sendmail systems that could
relay between Internet, DECnet, X.400 and UUCP.  Postfix is designed
to be flexible enough that it can operate in such environments
without requiring virtual domain or alias kludges.  However, the
initial release only talks SMTP, and has only limited support for
UUCP.

<p>

<li><a href="rewrite.html#virtual">Virtual domains</a>. In the most
common case, adding support for a virtual domain requires change
to only a single Postfix lookup table.  Other mailers usually need
multiple levels of aliasing or redirection to achieve the same
result.

<p>

<li><a href="uce.html">UCE control</a>. Postfix can restrict what
hosts can relay their mail through a Postfix system, and supports
restrictions on what mail is allowed to come in.  Postfix implements
the usual suspects:  blacklists, RBL lookups, HELO/sender DNS
lookups.  Content filtering hasn't been implemented yet.

<p>

<li><a href="rewrite.html">Table lookups</a>. Postfix does not yet
implement an address rewriting language. Instead it makes extensive
use of table lookups. Tables can be local <b>dbm</b> or <b>db</b>
files, or networked <b>NIS</b> or <b>NetInfo</b> maps. Adding
support for other lookup mechanisms is relatively easy.

</ul>
