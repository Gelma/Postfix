<hr>

<a name="poppers"><h3>POP or IMAP problems</h3>

Postfix is a mail delivery system. Postfix does not implement
services such as POP or IMAP to read mail. Several POP/IMAP
implementations exist that can cooperate with software such as
Postfix.

<p>

Examples of software that is used successfully with Postfix:

<p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://asg.web.cmu.edu/cyrus/">Cyrus IMAP</a> implements
IMAP, POP3, and KPOP, later versions also support TLS. This software
implements its own private mail database system. Not for beginners.

<p>

<li><a href="http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/">Courier-Imap</a>
provides POP3, IMAP, POP3 and IMAP, and supports access over SSL.
This software supports the maildir-style mailbox format only
(one message per file, same format as qmail).

<p>

<li><a href="http://www.eudora.com/qpopper/">Qpopper</a> supports 
POP3, TLS (SSL), and uses the traditional UNIX-style mailbox format
(multiple messages per file, each message starts with "From sender date...").

</ul>

<p>

<hr>

<a name="stand_alone"><h3>Stand-alone machine</h3>

Out of the box, Postfix should work without change on a stand-alone
machine that has direct Internet access.  At least, that is how
Postfix installs when you download the Postfix source code. If you
are on a firewalled intranet, or if your machine is dial-up connected
only a small part of the time, see the respective sections.

<hr>

<a name="workstation_server"><h3>Workstations and servers</h3>

This section describes a workstation-server environment. All systems
send mail as user@domain. All systems receive mail for user@hostname.
The server receives mail for user@domain, too.

<p>

Postfix has sane defaults for all parameters, so the text shows
only the overrides. In particular, Postfix will relay mail only
for clients in its own domain (and subdomains) and in its class A,
B or C networks. The master.cf file (somewhat like inetd.conf)
needs tweaking only if you have a very slow or a very fast net/machine.

<p>

Workstation:
<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        myorigin = $mydomain
</pre>

<p>

Server:
<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        myorigin = $mydomain
        mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, $mydomain
</pre>

<p>

In an environment like this. either the mail spool directory is
shared via NFS, users access their mailboxes via POP, or each user
receives her mail on her own workstation.  In the latter case, each
user has an alias on the server that forwards mail to the respective
workstation:

<p>

Server:
<pre>
    /etc/aliases:
        joe:    joe@joes.workstation
        jane:   jane@janes.workstation
</pre>

<p>

On some systems the alias database is not in <b>/etc/aliases</b>.
To find out the location for your system, execute the command
<b>postconf alias_maps</b>.

<hr>

<a name="null_client"><h3>Null clients</h3>

A null client is a machine that can only send mail. It receives no
mail from the network, and it does not deliver any mail locally. A
null client typically uses POP or NFS for mailbox access.

<p>

In the following example, mail is sent as user@domain, and all mail
is forwarded to the mail server that is responsible for the local
domain.

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        myorigin = $mydomain
        relayhost = $mydomain

    /etc/postfix/master.cf:
        Comment out the SMTP server entry
        Comment out the local delivery agent entry
</pre>

<p>

Since everything sends mail as user@domain, nothing sends mail as
user@nullclient, and therefore no special configuration needs to
be done on the mail server for mail addressed to user@nullclient.

<hr>

<a name="intranet"> <h3>Running Postfix inside an intranet</h3> </a>

The simplest way to set up Postfix on a host inside a firewalled
network is to send all your mail to an intranet mail gateway, and
to let that mail gateway take care of forwarding.

<p>

<ul>

<li>Send mail as user@domain. This is optional but highly recommended
because it allows users to change machines without hassle.

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        myorigin = $mydomain
</pre>

<p>

<li>Forward <i>all</i> mail to an intranet mail gateway, except
for mail for the local machine:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        relayhost = $mydomain
</pre>

<p>

This assumes that your organization has set up internal MX records
for the local domain.

<p>

If your intranet does not use MX records internally, you have to
specify the intranet mail gateway host itself:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        relayhost = host.my.domain
</pre>

<p>

If your intranet does not use DNS internally, you have to disable
DNS lookups as well:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        disable_dns_lookups = yes
</pre>

<p>

<li>In addition to the above you can configure Postfix to deliver
intranet mail directly instead of sending it via the intranet
mail gateway.

<p>

Specify routing information for the internal domain in the <a
href="transport.5.html">transport</a> table, and enable <a
href="transport.5.html">transport</a> table lookups.

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/transport:
        my.domain               smtp:
        .my.domain              smtp:
        thishost.my.domain      local:        !!!important!!!
        localhost.my.domain     local:        !!!important!!!

    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
</pre>

<p>

Important: do not omit the entries that deliver mail locally, or
else mail will bounce with a "mail loops to myself" condition.

<p>

Specify <b>dbm</b> instead of <b>hash</b> if your system uses
<b>dbm</b> files instead of <b>db</b>. To find out what map types
Postfix supports, use the command <b>postconf -m</b>.

<p>

Execute the command <b>postmap /etc/postfix/transport</b> whenever
you edit the transport table.

<p>

<li>Execute the command <b>postfix reload</b> to make the
changes effective.

</ul>

<hr>

<a name="firewall"><h3>Running Postfix on a firewall</h3> </a>

Note: this text applies to Postfix versions dated 19991115
and later only. To find out what Postfix version you have,
execute the command <b>postconf mail_version</b>.

<p>

How to set up Postfix on the firewall machine so that it relays
mail for <i>domain.com</i> to a gateway machine on the inside, and
so that it refuses mail for <i>*.domain.com</i>? The problem is that
the default <a href="uce.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a>
mail relaying restriction allows mail to <i>*.domain.com</i> when
you specify <i>domain.com</i>.

<p>

<ul>

<li>Specify a <a href="transport.5.html">transport</a> table to
route mail for <i>domain.com</i> to the inside machine.

<p>

Specify explicit settings for <a
href="uce.html#smtpd_recipient_restrictions">smtpd_recipient_restrictions</a>
and for <a href="basic.html#mynetworks">mynetworks</a> that allow
local systems to send mail anywhere, and that allow remote systems
to send mail only to <i>user@domain.com</i>.

<p>

<pre>
/etc/postfix/main.cf:
    myorigin = domain.com
    mydestination = domain.com
    transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
    mynetworks = 12.34.56.0/24
    smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks reject_unauth_destination

/etc/postfix/transport:
    domain.com   smtp:inside-gateway.domain.com   (forwards user@domain)

/etc/postfix/master.cf:
    Comment out the local delivery agent
</pre>

<p>

Specify <b>dbm</b> instead of <b>hash</b> if your system uses
<b>dbm</b> files instead of <b>db</b>. To find out what map types
Postfix supports, use the command <b>postconf -m</b>.

<p>

<li>Execute the command <b>postmap /etc/postfix/transport</b>
whenever you change the transport table.

<p>

<li>Execute the command <b>postfix reload</b> after a
configuration change.

</ul>

<hr>

<a name="dialup"><h3>Running Postfix on a dialup machine</h3></a>

This section applies to dialup connections that are down most of
the time. For dialup connections that are up 24x7, see the <a
href="#workstation_server">workstations and servers</a> section
instead. 

<p>

If you do not have your own hostname (as with dynamic IP addressing)
and must send mail as user@your-isp.com, you should also study the
the section on <a href="#some_local">delivering some users locally
while sending mail as user@domain</a>.

<ul>

<li> Route all outgoing mail to your provider.

<p>

If your machine is disconnected most of the time, there isn't
a lot of opportunity for Postfix to deliver mail to hard-to-reach
corners of the Internet. It's better to drop the mail to a machine
that is connected all the time.

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        relayhost = smtprelay.someprovider.com
</pre>

<p>

<li> <a name="spontaneous_smtp">Disable spontaneous SMTP mail
delivery (on-demand dialup IP only).</a>

<p>

Normally, Postfix attempts to deliver outbound mail at its convenience.
If your machine uses on-demand dialup IP, this causes your system
to place a telephone call whenever you submit new mail, and whenever
Postfix retries to deliver delayed mail. To prevent such telephone
calls from being placed, disable spontaneous SMTP mail deliveries.

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        defer_transports = smtp (Only for systems that use on-demand dialup IP)
</pre>

<p>

<li> Disable SMTP client DNS lookups (dialup LAN only).

<p>

Some people use Postfix to deliver mail across a LAN that is
disconnected most of the time.  Under such conditions, mail delivery
can suffer from delays while the Postfix SMTP client performs sender
and recipient domain DNS lookups in order to be standards-compliant.
To prevent these delays, disable all SMTP client DNS lookups.

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        disable_dns_lookups = yes (Only for delivery across LANs that are disconnected most of the time)
</pre>

<p>

<i> When you disable DNS lookups, you must specify the</i>
<b>relayhost</b> <i> as either a numeric IP address, or as a hostname
that resolves to one or more IP addresses (with DNS lookup disabled,
Postfix does no MX lookup</i>).

<p>

<li> Flush the mail queue whenever the Internet link is established.

<p>

Put the following command into your PPP or SLIP dialup scripts:

<p>

<dl>

<dd><b>/usr/sbin/sendmail -q</b> (whenever the Internet link is up)

</dl>

<p>

The exact location of the <b>sendmail</b> command is system-specific.
With some UNIX versions, use <b>/usr/lib/sendmail</b>.

<p>

In order to find out if the mail queue is flushed, use something
like:

<p>
<pre>
    #!/bin/sh

    # Start deliveries.
    /usr/sbin/sendmail -q

    # Allow deliveries to start.
    sleep 10

    # Loop until all messages have been tried at least once.
    while mailq | grep '^[^ ]*\*' &gt;/dev/null
    do  
        sleep 10
    done
</pre>

<p>

If you have disabled <a href="#spontaneous_smtp">spontaneous SMTP
mail delivery</a>, you also need to run the above command every
now and then while the dialup link is up, so that newly-posted mail
is flushed from the queue.

</ul>

<hr>

<a name="verbose"><h3>Postfix breaks "sendmail -v"</h3> </a>

Some people will complain that <b>sendmail -v</b> no longer shows
the actual mail delivery.

<p>

With a distributed mail system such as Postfix, this is difficult
to implement. Unlike sendmail, no Postfix mail delivery process
runs under control by a user. Instead, Postfix delivers mail with
daemon processes that have no parent-child relationship with user
processes.  This eliminates a large variety of potential security
exploits with environment variables, signal handlers, and with
other process attributes that UNIX passes on from parent process
to child process.

<p>

Postfix uses multiple processes in order to insulate subsystems
from each other.  Making the delivery agents talk directly to user
processes would defeat a lot of the effort that went into making
Postfix more secure than ordinary mailers.

<hr>

<a name="delayed"><h3>Postfix sends no "delayed mail" notices</h3>

<blockquote>

When I was using Sendmail, after 4 hours, it would always send a receipt
back to the sender saying mail delivery is delayed.

</blockquote>

<p>

In order to make Postfix send "delayed mail" notifications after
four hours, specify:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        delay_warning_time = 4
</pre>

<p>


With Postfix, delayed mail notices are turned off by default -
people get enough mail already.

<hr>

<a name="duplicate"><h3>Postfix sends duplicate mail</h3> </a>

Some people will complain that Postfix sends duplicate messages.
This happens whenever one message is mailed to multiple addresses
that reach the same user. Examples of such scenarios are:

<p>

<ul>

<li>One message is sent to the user, and to an alias that lists
the user.  The user receives one copy of the mail directly, and
one copy via the alias.

<p>

<li>One message is sent to multiple aliases that list the user.
The user receives one copy of the mail via each alias.

</ul>

<p>

Some people will even argue that this is the "right" behavior.  It
is probably more a matter of expectation and of what one is used to.

<p>

This can be "fixed" only by making Postfix slower.  In the above
examples, Postfix would first have to completely expand all
distribution lists before starting any delivery. By design, Postfix
delivers mail to different destinations in parallel, and local
delivery is no exception. This is why Postfix can be faster than
sendmail.

<hr>

<a name="metoo"><h3>Postfix sends mail to every member of a
distribution list</h3> </a>

Some people will complain that Postfix sends mail to every member
of a distribution list, including the poster.  By default, Sendmail
deletes the poster from distribution lists. Sendmail sends mail to
the poster only when the "metoo" flag is explicitly turned on.

<p>

Wietse believes that Postfix implements the "right" behavior,
and suspects that Sendmail's default behavior is a remnant from a
dark past when Sendmail used a pretty crummy algorithm to avoid
aliasing loops.

<hr>

<a name="owner-foo"><h3>Postfix ignores the owner-list alias</h3></a>

Normally, when a local alias <i>foo</i> has a companion alias
<i>owner-foo</i>, Postfix reports delivery errors to the owner
address rather than the message originator.

<p>

However, as a result of a Postfix implementation artefact, the
owner-foo alias takes effect only after the alias expansion is
completed.

<p>

Delivery problems that happen while expanding the alias, including
delivery to commands or files, are reported to the original sender
envelope address.

<p>

The reason is that bounces are sent by the Postfix queue manager,
which does not know that the sender address is being replaced.

<p>

This limitation will be fixed by changing how the Postfix local
delivery agent deals with undeliverable mail.

<hr>

<a name="noalias"><h3>What does "fatal: open database /etc/aliases.db" mean?</h3></a>

Your aliases database is corrupt or it is missing. Execute the 
following command as root:

<p>

<pre>
    # newaliases
</pre>

<hr>

<a name="nosuid"><h1>sendmail has set-uid root file permissions, or is run from a
set-uid root process</h3></a>

Traditionally, the UNIX <b>sendmail</b> command is installed with
set-uid root permissions. Even many MTAs other than Sendmail ship
with a set-uid root <b>sendmail</b> command. This is not the case
with Postfix.  The Postfix <b>sendmail</b> command is designed not
to be set-uid.

<p>

Unfortunately, some Linux systems have a helpful utility called
<b>linuxconf</b> that automatically "fixes" file permissions to
what they are supposed to be for Sendmail's <b>sendmail</b> command.
Even when you reset the set-uid bit on the Postfix <b>sendmail</b>
executable file, <b>linuxconf</b> will happily turn it on again
for you.

<p>

On SuSE systems the file permission fixing utulity is called
<b>SuSEconfig</b>.  Other Linux systems may use different names.
The usual disclaimers about mileages etc. apply.

<p>

<h4>Solutions</h4>

<ul>

<li>Rask Ingemann Lambertsen has a particularly effective
solution :-)

<blockquote>
<pre>
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/linuxconf stop && rpm --erase linuxconf 
</pre>
</blockquote>

<li>According to Matthias Andree, the band-aid fix for SuSE is to
add to /etc/permissions.local the following line:

<blockquote>
<pre>
/usr/sbin/sendmail root.root 755
</pre>
</blockquote>

and to make sure that in /etc/rc.config,
PERMISSIONS_SECURITY mentions local last, EXAMPLE:

<blockquote>
<pre>
CHECK_PERMISSIONS=set
PERMISSION_SECURITY="secure local"
</pre>
</blockquote>

</ul>

<hr>

<a name="whoami"><h3>sendmail: unable to find out your login name</h3>

This message is logged when submitting mail from a process with a
userid that does not exist in the UNIX password file.  Postfix uses
this information in order to set the envelope sender address.

I have lots if mail in the incoming queue, but Postfix only runs

</blockquote>

<p>

Your problem could be that the disk is saturated with I/O from
receiving mail, so that the Postfix queue manager gets insufficient
chance to process the requests (many SMTP server processes are
competing for disk access against one poor queue manager).

<p>

You solve the problem by getting faster disks.

<p>

I am still solving the scheduling problem from the software side,
but don't hold your breath.

<p>

Currently, the workaround is to configure multiple IP addresses
per machine, and to run one Postfix instance per IP address, each
instance preferably on a different disk.  The Postfix instances
can't share queue directories, but sharing mailbox directories is
OK.

<p>

Just start each Postfix instance with a different configuration
directory:

<p>

<pre>
    # postfix -c config_directory start

Each main.cf file has a different <b>$myhostname</b> setting,

<p>

Answer:

<blockquote>

You have a name service problem.

<p>

Postfix calls the C library routines <b>gethostbyname()</b> and
<b>gethostbyaddr()</b> in order to find out the SMTP client hostname.
These library routines use several system configuration files in
order to satisfy the request. They may in fact end up calling the
DNS for reasons that are not under control by Postfix.

<p>

Depending on your system, these controlling files can be named
<b>/etc/nsswitch.conf</b>, <b>/etc/svcorder</b>, <b>/etc/host.conf</b>
or otherwise.  Those files specify whether the C library routines
will use local <b>/etc/hosts</b> before or after DNS.

</blockquote>

<p>

You run the Postfix SMTP server inside a <b>chroot</b> jail for
extra security, but some configuration files are missing. In order
to run inside a chroot jail, the Postfix SMTP client and server
need copies of system configuration files inside the Postfix queue
directory.  The exact list of files is very system dependent, but
you will probably need at the very least:

<p>

<pre>
    /var/spool/postfix/etc/resolv.conf
    /var/spool/postfix/etc/services
</pre>

<p>

Of course, these directories and files must be owned by root, but
they must be accessible by the postfix user, so directories need
mode 0755 and files need mode 0644.

<p>

Don't Panic!  Upgrade to a Postfix version of 19991227 or later.
To find out what Postfix version you have, execute the command
<b>postconf mail_version</b>.

<p>

With earlier Postfix versions, 

<ol>

<li>Good but confusing: a Postfix primary MX host for <i>some.site</i>
accepts <i>test@some.other.site@some.site</i> then bounces it because
<i>test@some.other.site</i> is not a known local username.

<li>Good: a Postfix primary MX host for <i>some.site</i> rejects
other source-routed addresses such as <i>test%some.other.site@some.site</i>
or <i>some.other.site!test@some.site</i>.

<li>Loophole: a Postfix backup MX host for <i>some.site</i> forwards
source-routed addresses such as <i>test@some.other.site@some.site</i>
or <i>test%some.other.site@some.site</i> to a primary MX host for
<i>some.site</i>. Depending on the primary MX host's mailer
configuration, the primary MX host could then spam the mail into
the Internet.

</ol>

<p>

With newer Postfix versions,

<ol>

<li>A Postfix primary MX host for <i>some.site</i> host rejects
<i>test@some.other.site@some.site</i> just like it rejects
<i>test%some.other.site@some.site</i>.  This ends the confusion
mentioned in 1 above.

<li>A Postfix backup MX host for <i>some.site</i> host rejects
source-routed addresses including <i>test@some.other.site@some.site</i>.
This closes the loophole mentioned in 3 above.

</ol>

<p>

To be precise, Postfix UCE restrictions refuse to forward source-routed
addresses under the following conditions:

<p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="uce.html#check_relay_domains">check_relay_domains</a>:
reject when the destination is not local and when the client hostname
does not match <a href="uce.html#relay_domains">relay_domains</a>.

<li> <a
href="uce.html#permit_auth_destination">permit_auth_destination</a>:
skip when the destination is not local.

<li> <a
href="uce.html#reject_unauth_destination">reject_unauth_destination</a>:
reject when the destination is not local.

<li> <a href="uce.html#permit_mx_backup">permit_mx_backup</a>:
reject when the destination is not local.

<li> Other UCE restrictions (e.g., SMTPD access maps) are not aware
of sender-provided routing information.

</ul>

<p>

However, a Postfix primary MX host for still forwards source-routed
addresses <b>if received from a trusted client</b>, just like it
did before.

<p>

In order to have guaranteed protection against source-routed relaying
through trusted SMTP clients, specify a regular expression restriction
ahead of the other SMTPD recipient restrictions:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        smtpd_recipient_restrictions = 
            regexp:/etc/postfix/regexp_access
            ...other restrictions...

    /etc/postfix/regexp_access:
        /[%!@].*[%!@]/ 550 Sender specified routing is not supported here.
</pre>

<p>

This would be installed on all MX hosts.

</blockquote>

<p>

The most preferable way is to have users submit mail via some
authenticated protocol instead of plain old SMTP.

<p>

The next best way is to use plain old SMTP and to authenticate the
user first, for example, with a "please login via POP before using
SMTP" scheme.  In that case, some software 
maintains
a Postfix-compatible access table with client IP address information.
In order to make this work you need Postfix version 19991231 or later.

N.B. Some non-Postfix software such as <a

to adjust the above <b>check_client_access</b> restriction accordingly.

<p>

A less preferable way is based on client IP address (for example,
a 256-block) or DNS hostname (for example, whatever.pop.isp.com).
This scheme does not authenticate the user.  If you use IP/DNS-based
relay access control, pray that no customer with that same ISP
points their spam software at your machine, or else you may end up
on internet-wide black lists.

<p>

The least preferable way is based on the sender address. It is
trivially easy to spoof by anyone who ever received mail from your

spammer ever finds out the address of your users.

<a name="relay_restrict"><h3>Restricting what users can send mail to off-site destinations</h3>

<blockquote>

How can I configure Postfix in a way that some users can send mail
to the internet and other users not. The users with no access should
receive a generic bounce message. Please don't discuss whether such
access restrictions are necessary, it was not my decision.

</blockquote>

<p>

Postfix has support for per-user restrictions.  The restrictions
are implemented by the SMTP server. Thus, users that violate the
policy have their mail rejected by the SMTP server.  Like this:

<p>

<blockquote>

<pre>
554 &lt;user@remote&gt;: Access denied
</pre>

</blockquote>

<p>

The implementation uses two lookup tables. One table defines what
users are restricted in where they can send mail, and the other
table defines what destinations are local. It is left as an exercise
for the reader to change this into a scheme where only some users
have permission to send send mail to off-site destinations, and
where most users are restricted.

<p>

The example assumes DB/DBM files, but this could also be done with
LDAP or SQL.

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
            check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/restricted_senders

        local_only = check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/local_domains, reject

    /etc/postfix/restricted_senders:
        foo@domain      local_only
        bar@domain      local_only

    /etc/postfix/local_domains:
        this.domain     OK      <i>matches this.domain and subdomains</i>
        that.domain     OK      <i>matches that.domain and subdomains</i>
</pre>

<p>

Specify <B>dbm</b> instead of <b>hash</b> if your system uses
<b>dbm</b> files instead of <b>db</b> files. To find out what map

<p>

The <b>smtpd_restriction_classes</b> verbiage exists so that Postfix can
open <b>/etc/postfix/local_domains.db</b> before entering a chroot
jail, so it is only an artefact of implementation.

<p>

This scheme does not authenticate the user, therefore it can be
bypassed in several ways:

<p>

<ul>

<li>By sending mail as someone else who does have permission to
send mail to off-site destinations.

<p>

<li>By sending mail as yourself via a less restrictive mail relay
host.

</blockquote>

<p>

There can be several different problems.

<p>

<ul>

<li> First of all, the result of nslookup for the hostname may be
irrelevant. Postfix is required to look up the MX record first. So
your nslookup test should begin with asking for the MX record. Some
DNS servers are broken and produce no reply when asked for a
non-existent MX record.

<p> <li>

Check out your Postfix <b>master.cf</b> file. If the SMTP client
runs chrooted, then it needs a bunch of files inside the Postfix
queue directory.  Examples are in the source distribution in the
<b>examples</b> subdirectory.

<a name="timeouts"><h3>Mail fails consistently with timeout or lost connection</h3></a>

Every now and then, mail fails with "timed out while sending end
of data -- message may be sent more than once", or with: "lost
connection after DATA".  Network outages happen, systems crash.
There isn't much you can do about it. Usually the problem goes away
by itself.

<p>

However, when you see mail deliveries fail consistently, you may
have a different problem: broken path MTU discovery. Or it could
be a broken PIX firewall.

<h4>Cisco PIX "fixup protocol smtp" bug</h4>

The Cisco PIX firewall has a bug when running software older than
version 5.2(4) or 6.0(1).

<p>

The bug ID is CSCds90792. The "fixup protocol smtp" feature does
not correctly handle the case where the "." and the "CRLF" at the
end of mail are sent in separate packets.

<p>

How does one recognize a mailer behind a Cisco PIX with "fixup
protocol smtp" enabled? As of version 5.1 and later, the fixup
protocol smtp command changes the characters in the SMTP banner to
asterisks except for the "2", "0" and "0 SPACE" characters. 

<p>

When you connect to a mailer behind such a filter you see something
like:

<blockquote>
<pre>
220 **************************************0******0*********20 ****200**0*********0*00
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4>IP path MTU discovery</h4>

A little background is in order. With the SMTP protocol, the HELO,
MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands and responses are relatively short.
When you're talking to sendmail, every command and every response
is sent as a separate packet, because sendmail cannot implement
ESMTP command pipelining.

<p>

The message content, however, is sent as a few datagrams, each
datagram typically a kbyte large or even bigger, depending on your
local network MTU.

<p>

When mail fails consistently due to a timeout, I suspect that the
sending machine runs a modern UNIX which implements path MTU
discovery.  That causes the machine to send packets as large as it
would send over the LAN, with the IP DON'T FRAGMENT bit set,
preventing intermediate routers from fragmenting the packets that
are too big for their networks.

<p>

Depending on what network path a message follows, some router on
the way responds with an ICMP MUST FRAGMENT message saying the
packet is too big. Normally, the sending machine will re-send the
data after chopping it up into smaller pieces.

<p>

However, things break when some router closer to the sending system
is dropping such ICMP feedback messages, in a mistaken attempt to
protect systems against certain attacks. In that case, the ICMP
feedback message never reaches the sending machine, and the connection
times out.

<p>

This is the same configuration problem that causes trouble with
web servers behind a misconfigured packet filter: small images/files
are sent intact, large images/files time out because the server
does not see the MUST FRAGMENT ICMP feedback messages.

<p>

Workaround: disable path MTU discovery at the sending machine. Mail
will get out, but of course everyone else will still suffer. How
to disable path MTU discovery? It depends. Solaris has an <b>ndd</b>
command; other systems use different means such as <b>sysctl</b>
to control kernel parameters on a running system.

<p>

Fix: find the router that drops the ICMP MUST FRAGMENT messages,
and convince the person responsible for it to fix the configuration.

<hr>

<a name="skip_greeting"><h3>Postfix does not try all the MX
addresses</h3>

When delivering mail, Postfix tries all MX addresses in order of
preference, and stops at the first server that speaks SMTP.

<p>

If the first server that speaks SMTP rejects the connection by
greeting the client with a 5xx status code, which means "I will
never accept your mail", Postfix gives up and bounces the message
to the sender.

<p>

If the first server that speaks SMTP rejects the connection by
greeting the client with a 4xx status code, which means "come back
later", Postfix backs off and defers delivery until later.

<p>

Some people will argue that Postfix should contact the other MX
addresses even when the server greets with 4xx or 5xx, if only
because that is what Sendmail does, and of course we know that
everything Sendmail does is right.

<p>

Unfortunately, some people configure their infrastructure badly.
Their most preferred MX server is visible to the world but it
rejects connections from outside with a 5xx or 4xx greeting. Just
because Sendmail goes to the second-best MX server, these people
assume that every mailer will do so.

<p>

If such configurations are a problem for you, below are some controls
that work around them.

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        smtp_skip_4xx_greeting = yes
        smtp_skip_5xx_greeting = yes

later than 20000104. To find out what Postfix version you have,

<a name="bogus"><h3>Postfix accepts mail for non-existing local users</h3>

See elsewhere for how to reject mail for <a

<p>

The information in this section applies to Postfix versions 19991216
and later.  To find out what Postfix version you have, execute the
command <b>postconf mail_version</b>.

<p>

By default, the Postfix SMTP server does not know what local users
exist, and will happily accept mail for <i>unknown@your.site</i>.
The reason is that different local delivery agents have different
types of user databases.

<p>

Of course mail for a non-existent local user will eventually bounce
as undeliverable, but why accept such mail in the first place? You
can tell the Postfix SMTP server how to find out if a user exists by
listing all tables with local addresses in the <b>local_recipient_maps</b>
parameter. 

<p>

For example, if you use the default Postfix local delivery agent
in <b>/etc/postfix/master.cf</b>, specify:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        local_recipient_maps = $alias_maps, unix:passwd.byname
</pre>

<p>

However, if you run the Postfix SMTP server chrooted, on some

<a name="maildir"><h3>Support for maildir-style mailboxes</h3> </a>

<b>Maildir</b> is a specific one-file-per-message organization that
was introduced with the <b>qmail</b> system by Daniel Bernstein.
In order to turn on <b>maildir</b>-style delivery, specify,
for example:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        home_mailbox = Maildir/
</pre>

<p>

Any relative pathname that ends in <b>/</b> turns on <b>maildir</b>
delivery.  The <b>home_mailbox</b> value is appended to the user's
home directory pathname.

<p>

The <b>maildir</b> format is also supported with delivery via
aliases or via <b>.forward</b> files. Specify <i>/file/name/</i>
as destination.  The trailing <b>/</b> turns on <b>maildir</b>
delivery.

<hr>

<a name="procmail"><h3>Using Procmail for system-wide local delivery</h3> </a>

Warning: if you use <b>procmail</b> in this manner, you must set

If you can, avoid using any shell meta characters or built-ins such

<a name="delivered"><h3>Getting rid of the ugly Delivered-To: header</h3> </a>

Some people will complain about the ugly <b>Delivered-To:</b>
message header that Postfix prepends to their mail.  By default,
Postfix prepends this header when forwarding mail, and when delivering
to file (mailbox) or command. The purpose is to stop mail forwarding
loops as early as possible, that is, before they have a chance to
happen.  But the header is ugly, no question about it.

<p>

Solutions, ranging from fighting symptoms to turning off the
<b>Delivered-To:</b> header:

<p>

<ul>

<li>

Fortunately, many mail user agents have per-user or even system-wide
configuration files that can be set up to suppress <b>Delivered-To:</b>
headers (for example <b>~/.mailrc</b> and <b>/usr/lib/Mail.rc</b>).

<p>

<li>

With mailing lists, <b>Delivered-To:</b> can get in the way when
the list exploder uses a "secret" alias that should not be shown
in outbound mail. The recommended solution is to use a regular
expression-based filter at the SMTP port:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        smtpd_recipient_restrictions = 
            ... regexp:/etc/postfix/access_regexp ...
        smtpd_recipient_restrictions = 
            ... pcre:/etc/postfix/access_regexp ...

    /etc/postfix/access_regexp:
        /^(.*)-outgoing@(.*)/   554 Use $1@$2 instead
</pre>

<p>

POSIX regular expression support (regexp) is enabled by default on
modern UNIX systems. Perl-compatible regular expression support
(pcre) is optional; see the PCRE_README file in the top-level
Postfix source directory.

<p>

<li>

The <b>prepend_delivered_header</b> configuration parameter controls
when <b>Delivered-To:</b> is prepended. The default setting is
<b>command, file, forward</b> (translation: prepend <b>Delivered-To:</b>
when delivering to command, when delivering to file, and when
forwarding mail).  <i>Turning off <b>Delivered-To:</b> when forwarding
mail is not recommended</i>.

</ul>

<p>

See also the FAQ item for problems with the <b>majordomo</b> <a
href="#majordomo-approve">approve</a> command.

<hr>

<a name="majordomo-approve"><h3>Postfix breaks the majordomo "approve"
command</h3> </a>

The Postfix local delivery agent prepends a <b>Delivered-To:</b>
message header to prevent mail forwarding loops.  With <b>majordomo</b>
mailing lists, <b>Delivered-To:</b> gets in the way when the
moderator wants to approve postings that were sent to the list.
The Postfix system claims that the mail is looping.

<p>

Currently, the recommended workaround is to edit the <b>approve</b>
script to strip any header lines that match:

<p>

<pre>
    /delivered-to/i

</pre>

<p>

Yes, this assumes that the moderator knows what she is doing.

<p>

A less-preferred workaround is to not insert <b>Delivered-To:</b>
when delivering to commands such as majordomo. See the FAQ entry
titled "<a href="#delivered">Getting rid of the ugly Delivered-To:
header</a>".

<hr>

<a name="worm"><h3>Postfix accepts MAIL FROM and RCPT TO "| command"</h3>

With Postfix, | or / has special meaning only when it appears in
aliases, .forward files or in :include: files. It has no special
meaning in mail addresses.


<p>

If you must receive mail for systems with 10-year old vulnerabilities,
it is prudent to set up a regexp filter that rejects potentially
harmful MAIL FROM or RCPT TO commands.

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        smtpd_sender_restrictions =
            regexp:/etc/postfix/envelope-regexp
            reject_unknown_sender_domain
        smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
            regexp:/etc/postfix/envelope-regexp
            permit_mynetworks
            check_relay_domains

    /etc/postfix/envelope-regexp:
        /[/|]/  REJECT
</pre>

<p>

However, rejecting all envelope addresses with / causes trouble
with simple-minded X.400 to Internet address mappings that leave
the X.400 address structure exposed.

<p>

See also the documentation on <a href="uce.html#header_checks">header
checks</a> restrictions for message header contents. These restrictions
can be used to protect against attacks with command/file destinations
in, for example, Errors-To: or Return-Receipt_To:  message headers.

<hr>

<a name="internal-list"><h3>Protecting internal email distribution lists</h3>

<blockquote>

We want to implement an internal email distribution list.  Something
like all@our.domain.com, which aliases to all employees.  My first
thought was to use the aliases map, but that would lead to "all"
being accessible from the "outside", and this is not desired...
:-)

</blockquote>

Postfix can implement per-address access controls.  What follows
is based on the SMTP client IP address, and therefore is subject
to IP spoofing.

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
            hash:/etc/postfix/access
            ..the usual stuff...

    /etc/postfix/access:
        all     permit_mynetworks,reject
</pre>

<p>

Specify <B>dbm</b> instead of <b>hash</b> if your system uses
<b>dbm</b> files instead of <b>db</b> files. To find out what map
types Postfix supports, use the command <b>postconf -m</b>.

<p>

Now, that would be sufficient when your machine receives all Internet
mail directly from the Internet.  That's unlikely if your network
is a bit larger than an office. For example your backup MX hosts
would "launder" the client IP address of mail from outside so it
would appear to come from a trusted machine.

<p>

In the general case you need two lookup tables: one table that
lists destinations that need to be protected, and one table that
lists domains that are allowed to send to the protected destinations.

<p>

What follows is based on the sender SMTP envelope address, and
therefore is subject to SMTP sender spoofing.

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
            hash:/etc/postfix/protected_destinations
            ..the usual stuff...

        smtpd_restriction_classes = insiders_only
        insiders_only = check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/insiders, reject

    /etc/postfix/protected_destinations:
        all@my.domain   insiders_only
        all@my.hostname insiders_only

    /etc/postfix/insiders:
        my.domain       OK
        another.domain  OK
</pre>

<p>

The smtpd_restriction_classes verbiage is needed so that Postfix
knows what lookup tables to open before it goes to chroot jail.
It is only an artefact of the implementation.

<p>

Getting past this scheme is relatively easy, because all one has
to do is to spoof the SMTP sender address.

<p>

If the internal list is a low-volume one, perhaps it makes more
sense to make it moderated.

<p>

Long reply follows.

<p>

Delivering mail to a command is a security-sensitive operation,
because the command must be executed with the right privileges.
Only <b>root</b>-privileged software such as the Postfix local
delivery agent can set the privileges for a command.

<p>

For security reasons, Postfix tries to avoid using <b>root</b>
privileges where possible. In particular, Postfix virtual mapping
is done by an unprivileged daemon, so there is no secure way to
execute commands found in virtual maps.

<hr>

<a name="domain_mailbox"><h3>Receiving a virtual domain in a mailbox</h3>

Question: how to receive all mail for a domain in a mailbox without
losing the original recipient information? The Postfix Delivered-To:
mail header shows only the mailbox owner, not the virtual address
that the mail was sent to.

<p>

Answer: I hope we all agree that delivering a domain to a mailbox
is disgusting practice. Forwarding mail via SMTP or UUCP would be
a much better choice.  Unfortunately, neither SMTP nor UUCP are a
usable alternative for legions of windows users.

<p>

That said, it is possible to propagate the original virtual recipient
information to the Delivered-To: header. The trick is to use a
virtual map that uses regular expressions instead of the more
traditional indexed files.

<p>

The following delivers <i>username@virtual.domain</i> with a
Delivered-To: message header that contains <i>joe+username@your.domain</i>.
Postfix already puts the envelope sender address in the Return-Path:
header.  The information in the Delivered-To: and Return-Path:
headers is sufficient to reliably implement a domain in a mailbox.

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        recipient_delimiter = +
        virtual_maps = 
            ...non-regexp virtual maps...
            regexp:/etc/postfix/virtual_regexp

    /etc/postfix/virtual_regexp:
        /^virtual\.domain$/             whatever
        /^(.*)@virtual\.domain$/        joe+$1
</pre>

<p>

Notes:

<ul>

<li> Be sure to specify the <b>^</b> and <b>\</b> and <b>$</b> or
else you may have false hits.

<li> Maps with regular expressions are searched sequentially. This
can be expensive when you list many domains in regular expression
maps.

<li> Postfix has <b>regexp </b> map support only on modern UNIXes.
Instead of <b>regexp </b> maps your Postfix system may also support
<b>pcre</b> maps which have a similar syntax. To find out what maps
your system supports, use the command <b>postconf -m</b>.

</ul>

<hr>

<a name="masquerade"><h3>Address masquerading with exceptions</h3></a>

For people outside your organization it can be desirable to only
see addresses of the form <i>user@company.com</i> rather than
addresses with individual internal host names.  This can be achieved
with address masquerading.

<p>

Address masquerading is intended for use only on mail gateways.

<ul>

<li>In order to have all mail through the gateway host appear as
coming from <i>user@my.domain</i>, specify:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        masquerade_domains = $mydomain
</pre>

<p>

Note that the gateway should have <b><a
href="rewrite.html#append_dot_mydomain">append_dot_mydomain</a></b>
and <b><a href="rewrite.html#append_at_myorigin">append_at_myorigin</a></b>
turned on (which is the default setting) so that all addresses are
fully qualified before they are subjected to address masquerading.

</ul>

<p>

In some cases, you may wish to have certain users or hosts exempted
from masquerading.

<ul>

<li>To exempt certain <i>users</i> from masquerading,
such as <b>root</b>, specify:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        masquerade_exceptions = root
</pre>

<p>

<li>To exempt certain <i>hosts</i> from masquerading, write
<b>masquerade_domains</b> as:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        masquerade_domains = somehost.my.domain otherhost.my.domain $mydomain
</pre>

<p>

Note that the order above is crucial: exemptions such as
<i>somehost.my.domain</i> must precede <i>$mydomain</i> in the
statement.

<p>

It should go without saying that if a particular host you wish to
exempt this way is originating mail as <i>user@my.domain</i> in
the first place, you can hardly exempt it.

<p>

</ul>

As usual, execute the command <b>postfix reload</b> to make the changes
effective.

<a name="scanning"><h3>Support for virus scanning</h3> </a>

Would not it be great if operating systems and applications actually
worked the way they are supposed to, instead of being as fragile
as today's products? Well, we can solve only one problem at a time.

<p>

Currently, Postfix has no hooks to let other programs inspect every
message, so the scanning has to be done before mail enters Postfix
or while mail leaves Postfix, for example at mailbox delivery time.

<p>

Examples:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        mailbox_command = /some/program ...
</pre>

<p>

This example specifies a command that delivers all local mail to
mailbox.  See the sample <b>main.cf</b> file for examples. In
<b>/etc/aliases</b>, you must specify an alias for <b>root</b> that
directs mail to a real person, otherwise mail sent to <b>root</b>
will not work as expected.

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        mailbox_transport = foo
</pre>

<p>

This example delegates local mailbox delivery to the transport
<i>foo</i> as configured in <b>/etc/postfix/master.cf</b>. If you
follow this route you will build something around the pipe mailer.
See examples in <b>master.cf</b>.

<a name="internet-uucp"><h3>Setting up an Internet to UUCP gateway</h3> </a>

Here is how to set up a machine that sits on the Internet and that

<a href="#uucp-only">UUCP-only</a> FAQ entry for setting a UUCP-only
host.

<p>

<ul>

<li>You need an <b>rmail</b> program that extracts the sender
address from mail that arrives via UUCP, and that feeds the mail
into the Postfix <b>sendmail</b> command.  Most UNIX systems come
with an <b>rmail</b> utility. If you're in a pinch, try the one
bundled with the Postfix source code in the <b>auxiliary</b>
directory. Some day Postfix may have its own <b>rmail</b> command.

<p>

<li>Specify that mail for, let's say, <i>some.domain</i>, should
be delivered via UUCP, for example, to a host named <i>uucp-host</i>:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/transport:
        some.domain     uucp:uucp-host
        .some.domain    uucp:uucp-host
</pre>

<p>

See the <a href="transport.5.html">transport</a> manual page
for more details.

<p>

<li>Execute the command <b>postmap /etc/postfix/transport</b> whenever
you change the <b>transport</b> file.

<p>

<li>Enable <b>transport</b> table lookups:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/main.cf:
        transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
</pre>

<p>

Specify <B>dbm</b> instead of <b>hash</b> if your system uses
<b>dbm</b> files instead of <b>db</b> files. To find out what map
types Postfix supports, use the command <b>postconf -m</b>.

<p>

<li>Define a mail transport for delivery via UUCP:

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/master.cf:
        uucp      unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
          flags=F user=uucp argv=uux -r -n -z -a$sender - $nexthop!rmail ($recipient)
</pre>

<p>

This runs the <b>uux</b> command, and substitutes the next-hop
hostname (<i>uucp-host</i>) and the recipients before executing
the command.  The <b>uux</b> command is executed without assistance
from the shell, so there are no problems with shell meta characters.

<p>

<li>Add <i>some.domain</i> to the list of domains that your site
is willing to relay mail for.

<p>

<pre>

<p>

This runs the <b>uux</b> command, and substitutes the next-hop

<a name="fax"><h3>Sending mail to a FAX machine</h3></a>

The following information is by Joerg Henne:

<p>

<pre>
    /etc/postfix/master.cf:
        fax       unix  -       n       n       -       1       pipe

        transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
	fax_destination_recipient_limit = 1
</pre>

<p>

The process limit of 1 in the <b>master.cf</b> file is necessary
with fax software that cannot handle multiple requests at the same
time. It won't hurt otherwise.

<p>

The <b>fax_destination_recipient_limit</b> entry (by Simon, Mr.
Simix) is necessary with fax software that can't have more than
one destination on its command line. It won't hurt otherwise.

<hr>

<a name="deleting"><h3>Deleting a message from the Postfix queue</h3></a>

To delete ONE message with queue id ABCDEF (e.g., from <b>mailq</b>
output) from the Postfix queue, it is not necessary to stop Postfix.

<p>

<pre>
    # cd /var/spool/postfix
    # find incoming active deferred -name ABCDEF -print | sed 1q | xargs rm
</pre>

<p>

The above command is safe because it deletes at most one file.
There is no risk of deleting newly arrived mail that happens to get
the same queue file name.

<p>

If you have to delete a large amount of mail, you must stop Postfix
first.

<p>
<pre>
    # postfix stop
    # cd /var/spool/postfix
    # find incoming active deferred defer -type f -print |
	fgrep -xf /file/with/queue-ids | xargs rm
    # postfix start
</pre>

<p>

Do not use the above <b>find</b> command on a running Postfix
system, because it can delete files that belong to new mail that
arrives while you are deleting queue files.

<hr>

<a name="copying"><h3>Moving or restoring the Postfix queue</h3></a>

It is not safe to simply copy Postfix queue files from one file
system (or backup) to another file system. The reason for this is
that queue file names must be unique across the Postfix <b>incoming</b>,
<b>active</b> and <b>deferred</b> queue directories.  If two queue
files have the same file (base) name, then one of the queue files
may be lost as files are moved from queue directory to queue
directory.

<p>

Postfix names a queue file after its inode number and after the
microsecond part of the time of day.  Thus, if a queue file has a
name based on someone elses inode number there is a small chance
that the file name will collide with another queue file.

<p>

To avoid queue file name collisions when copying queue files,
restore queue files in the maildrop directory instead.

<p>
<pre>
    # postfix stop
    ... restore queue files under the maildrop directory...
    # postfix start
</pre>

<p>

When Postfix is started, it will pick up queue files from the
maildrop directory and will give them proper queue file names.

Answer: you're mixing BIND version 8 include files with a

Question: When I build Postfix I get the following errors:

<p>

<pre>
    Undefined                       first referenced
     symbol                             in file
       dbm_pagfno                          ../lib/libutil.a(dict_dbm.o)
       dbm_dirfno                          ../lib/libutil.a(dict_dbm.o)
</pre>

<p>

Answer: instead of using <b>/usr/include/ndbm.h</b>, you're building
Postfix with some incompatible third-party file, typically
<b>/usr/local/include/ndbm.h</b>.

<p>

Fix: get rid of the third-party ndbm.h include file.

<a name="db"><h3>Using third-party DB libraries</h3> </a>

The old <b>dbm</b> UNIX database has severe limitations when you
try to store lots of information. It breaks when the number of hash
collisions becomes so large that the entries no longer fit together
in a single disk block.  The more modern <b>db</b> database does
not suffer these limitations. It is standard on 4.4BSD and Linux
systems.

<p>

In order to build Postfix with <b>db</b> support on UNIX systems
that do not have <b>db</b> support out of the box, you can use the
Berkeley DB source code from <a
href="http://www.sleepycat.com">www.sleepycat.com</a>. See the file
<b>DB_README</b> in the Postfix source code distribution for
instructions on how to build Postfix with Sleepycat's Berkeley DB.

<h3>IRIX problems translating IP address to string</h3>

<dl>

<dt>Question:  <dd> While installing IRIX 6.5.7m on a clean disk
and no special options or software I stumbled upon the following
problem; the inet_ntoa() function seems to return INADDR_NONE
(malformed request?) for every call to it.  

<p>

<dt>Answer: <dd>There is an incompatibility between gcc and system
libraries compiled with SGI's cc.  See a description in <a
href="http://freeware.sgi.com/shared/howto.html">
http://freeware.sgi.com/shared/howto.html</a>.

<p>If you must use gcc, a possible workaround is to use the
inet_ntoa() routine from the BIND source code at <a
href="http://www.isc.org/"> http://www.isc.org/</a>.

<a name="compaq-chmod"><h3>Compaq mail blackhole problem</h3>

On some Compaq Tru64 UNIX configurations, Postfix will receive mail
and then nothing happens. The mail does not even show up with the
<b>mailq</b> command.

<p>

Postfix sets the execute bit on a queue file to indicate that it
is done receiving a message. As long as a queue file does not have
the execute bit set, Postfix will ignore it as "mail still being
received".

<p>

With enhanced security enabled, Compaq Tru64 UNIX has a feature
that disallows non-superuser attempts to set the execute bit on a
queuefile.  Unfortunately, Postfix is never informed that such
attempts fail, and mail seems to disappear into a black hole.

<p>

Postfix could be modified to use some other bit than the execute
bit, but that might equally well fail on other systems. Another
possibility is to allow non-superusers to set the execute bit on
files, and to mount the Postfix queue file system with the
<b>noexec</b> option or equivalent.
