PROXYMAP(8)                                           PROXYMAP(8)

<b>NAME</b>
       proxymap - Postfix lookup table proxy server

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>proxymap</b> [generic Postfix daemon options]

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>proxymap</b>  server provides read-only table lookup ser-
       vice to Postfix client processes. The purpose of the  ser-
       vice is:

       <b>o</b>      To  overcome  chroot  restrictions.  For example, a
              chrooted SMTP server needs  access  to  the  system
              passwd  file  in order to reject mail for non-exis-
              tent local addresses, but it is  not  practical  to
              maintain  a  copy  of the passwd file in the chroot
              jail.  The solution:

              local_recipient_maps =
                  proxy:unix:passwd.byname $alias_maps

       <b>o</b>      To consolidate the number of open lookup tables  by
              sharing  one  open  table among multiple processes.
              For example, making mysql  connections  from  every
              Postfix daemon process results in "too many connec-
              tions" errors. The solution:

              virtual_alias_maps =
                  proxy:mysql:/etc/postfix/virtual_alias.cf

              The total number of connections is limited  by  the
              number of proxymap server processes.

       The proxymap server implements the following requests:

       <b>PROXY</b><i>_</i><b>REQ</b><i>_</i><b>OPEN</b> <i>maptype:mapname</i> <i>flags</i>
              Open  the table with type <i>maptype</i> and name <i>mapname</i>,
              as controlled by <i>flags</i>.  The reply is  the  request
              completion  status  code  (below)  and the map type
              dependent flags.

       <b>PROXY</b><i>_</i><b>REQ</b><i>_</i><b>LOOKUP</b> <i>maptype:mapname</i> <i>flags</i> <i>key</i>
              Look up the data stored under  the  requested  key.
              The  reply  is  the  request completion status code
              (below) and the  lookup  result  value.   The  <i>map-</i>
              <i>type:mapname</i>  and  <i>flags</i>  are  the same as with the
              <b>PROXY</b><i>_</i><b>REQ</b><i>_</i><b>OPEN</b> request.

       There is no  close  command,  nor  are  tables  implicitly
       closed  when  a client disconnects. One of the purposes of
       the proxymap server is  to  share  tables  among  multiple
       client processes.

       The request completion status code is one of:

       <b>PROXY</b><i>_</i><b>STAT</b><i>_</i><b>OK</b>
              The  specified  table  was opened, or the requested
              entry was found.

       <b>PROXY</b><i>_</i><b>STAT</b><i>_</i><b>NOKEY</b>
              The requested table entry was not found.

       <b>PROXY</b><i>_</i><b>STAT</b><i>_</i><b>BAD</b>
              The request was  rejected  (bad  request  parameter
              value).

       <b>PROXY</b><i>_</i><b>STAT</b><i>_</i><b>RETRY</b>
              The lookup request could not be completed.

       <b>PROXY</b><i>_</i><b>STAT</b><i>_</i><b>DENY</b>
              The specified table was not approved for access via
              the proxymap service.

<b>SERVER</b> <b>PROCESS</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b>
       The proxymap servers run under control by the Postfix mas-
       ter  server.  Each server can handle multiple simultaneous
       connections.  When all servers are  busy  while  a  client
       connects,  the  master  creates a new proxymap server pro-
       cess, provided that the proxymap server process  limit  is
       not exceeded.  Each proxymap server terminates after serv-
       ing at least <b>$max</b><i>_</i><b>use</b> clients or after  <b>$max</b><i>_</i><b>idle</b>  seconds
       of idle time.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       The  proxymap  server  opens only tables that are approved
       via the <b>proxy</b><i>_</i><b>read</b><i>_</i><b>maps</b> configuration parameter, does  not
       talk  to  users,  and  can  run  at  fixed  low privilege,
       chrooted or not.

       The proxymap server is not a trusted daemon  process,  and
       must  not be used to look up sensitive information such as
       user or group IDs, mailbox file/directory names or  exter-
       nal commands.

<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).

<b>BUGS</b>
       The  proxymap server provides service to multiple clients,
       and must therefore not be used for tables that have  high-
       latency lookups.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The  following  main.cf parameters are especially relevant
       to this program. Use the <b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>  command  after  a
       configuration change.

       <b>proxy</b><i>_</i><b>read</b><i>_</i><b>maps</b>
              A  list  of  zero or more parameter values that may
              contain references to Postfix lookup  tables.  Only
              table   references   that  begin  with  <b>proxy:</b>  are
              approved for  read-only  access  via  the  proxymap
              server.
