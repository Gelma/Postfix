PIPE(8)                                                   PIPE(8)


<b>NAME</b>
       pipe - Postfix delivery to external command

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
       <b>pipe</b> [generic Postfix daemon options] command_attributes...

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       The  <b>pipe</b> daemon processes requests from the Postfix queue
       manager to deliver messages  to  external  commands.  Each
       delivery request specifies a queue file, a sender address,
       a domain or host to deliver to, and one  or  more  recipi-
       ents.   This  program expects to be run from the <a href="master.8.html"><b>master</b>(8)</a>
       process manager.

       The <b>pipe</b> daemon updates queue files and  marks  recipients
       as finished, or it informs the queue manager that delivery
       should be tried again at a later  time.  Delivery  problem
       reports  are  sent  to the <a href="bounce.8.html"><b>bounce</b>(8)</a> or <a href="defer.8.html"><b>defer</b>(8)</a> daemon as
       appropriate.

<b>COMMAND</b> <b>ATTRIBUTE</b> <b>SYNTAX</b>
       The external command attributes are given in the <b>master.cf</b>
       file at the end of a service definition.  The syntax is as
       follows:

       <b>flags=FR.</b>&gt; (optional)
              Optional message processing flags.  By  default,  a
              message is copied unchanged.

              <b>F</b>      Prepend  a "<b>From</b> <i>sender</i> <i>time_stamp</i>" envelope
                     header to  the  message  content.   This  is
                     expected by, for example, <b>UUCP</b> software. The
                     <b>F</b> flag also  causes  an  empty  line  to  be
                     appended to the message.

              <b>R</b>      Prepend  a  <b>Return-Path:</b> message header with
                     the envelope sender address.

              <b>.</b>      Prepend <b>.</b> to lines starting with  "<b>.</b>".  This
                     is needed by, for example, <b>BSMTP</b> software.

              &gt;      Prepend  &gt;  to  lines starting with "<b>From</b> ".
                     This is expected by, for example, <b>UUCP</b> soft-
                     ware.

       <b>user</b>=<i>username</i> (required)

       <b>user</b>=<i>username</i>:<i>groupname</i>
              The external command is executed with the rights of
              the specified <i>username</i>.  The  software  refuses  to
              execute  commands with root privileges, or with the
              privileges of the mail system owner.  If  <i>groupname</i>
              is  specified,  the  corresponding group ID is used
              instead of the group ID of of <i>username</i>.



                                                                1





PIPE(8)                                                   PIPE(8)


       <b>argv</b>=<i>command</i>... (required)
              The command to be executed. This must be  specified
              as the last command attribute.  The command is exe-
              cuted  directly,  i.e.  without  interpretation  of
              shell  meta  characters  by  a shell command inter-
              preter.

              In  the  command  argument  vector,  the  following
              macros are recognized and replaced with correspond-
              ing information  from  the  Postfix  queue  manager
              delivery request:

              <b>${extension</b>}
                     This  macro expands to the extension part of
                     a recipient address.  For example,  with  an
                     address  <i>user+foo@domain</i>  the  extension  is
                     <i>foo</i>.  A command-line argument that  contains
                     <b>${extension</b>}  expands  into as many command-
                     line arguments as there are recipients.

              <b>${mailbox</b>}
                     This macro expands  to  the  complete  local
                     part  of  a recipient address.  For example,
                     with an address <i>user+foo@domain</i> the  mailbox
                     is  <i>user+foo</i>.   A command-line argument that
                     contains <b>${mailbox</b>}  expands  into  as  many
                     command-line  arguments as there are recipi-
                     ents.

              <b>${nexthop</b>}
                     This macro expands to the next-hop hostname.

              <b>${recipient</b>}
                     This macro expands to the complete recipient
                     address.  A command-line argument that  con-
                     tains <b>${recipient</b>} expands into as many com-
                     mand-line arguments as there are recipients.

              <b>${sender</b>}
                     This  macro  expands  to the envelope sender
                     address.

              <b>${user</b>}
                     This macro expands to the username part of a
                     recipient  address.   For  example,  with an
                     address <i>user+foo@domain</i> the username part is
                     <i>user</i>.  A command-line argument that contains
                     <b>${user</b>} expands into  as  many  command-line
                     arguments as there are recipients.

       In  addition  to  the  form  ${<i>name</i>},  the forms $<i>name</i> and
       $(<i>name</i>) are also recognized.  Specify <b>$$</b> where a single  <b>$</b>
       is wanted.




                                                                2





PIPE(8)                                                   PIPE(8)


<b>DIAGNOSTICS</b>
       Command  exit status codes are expected to follow the con-
       ventions defined in &lt;<b>sysexits.h</b>&gt;.

       Problems and transactions are logged to <b>syslogd</b>(8).   Cor-
       rupted  message files are marked so that the queue manager
       can move them to the <b>corrupt</b> queue for further inspection.

<b>SECURITY</b>
       This  program  needs  a  dual personality 1) to access the
       private Postfix queue and IPC mechanisms, and 2)  to  exe-
       cute external commands as the specified user. It is there-
       fore security sensitive.

<b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b>
       The following <b>main.cf</b> parameters are  especially  relevant
       to  this  program. See the Postfix <b>main.cf</b> file for syntax
       details and for default values.  Use  the  <b>postfix</b>  <b>reload</b>
       command after a configuration change.

<b>Miscellaneous</b>
       <b>mail</b><i>_</i><b>owner</b>
              The  process  privileges  used while not running an
              external command.

<b>Resource</b> <b>controls</b>
       In the text below, <i>transport</i> is the first field in a  <b>mas-</b>
       <b>ter.cf</b> entry.

       <i>transport_</i><b>destination</b><i>_</i><b>concurrency</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>
              Limit the number of parallel deliveries to the same
              destination, for delivery via the named  <i>transport</i>.
              The  default limit is taken from the <b>default</b><i>_</i><b>desti-</b>
              <b>nation</b><i>_</i><b>concurrency</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b> parameter.  The  limit  is
              enforced by the Postfix queue manager.

       <i>transport_</i><b>destination</b><i>_</i><b>recipient</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>
              Limit  the  number of recipients per message deliv-
              ery, for delivery  via  the  named  <i>transport</i>.  The
              default  limit  is  taken from the <b>default</b><i>_</i><b>destina-</b>
              <b>tion</b><i>_</i><b>recipient</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>  parameter.   The   limit   is
              enforced by the Postfix queue manager.

       <i>transport_</i><b>time</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b>
              Limit  the  time  for delivery to external command,
              for delivery via the named <b>transport</b>.  The  default
              limit  is taken from the <b>command</b><i>_</i><b>time</b><i>_</i><b>limit</b> parame-
              ter.  The limit is enforced by  the  Postfix  queue
              manager.
