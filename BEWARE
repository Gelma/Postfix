LINUX SYSLOGD PERFORMANCE
=========================

LINUX syslogd uses synchronous writes by default, which is very
expensive. For services such a mail it is recommended that you
disable synchronous logfile writes by prepending a - to the logfile
name:

    mail.*                          -/var/log/mail.log
