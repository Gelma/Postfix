/* NAME
/*	bounce_notify_service 3
/* SUMMARY
/*	send non-delivery report to sender, server side
/* SYNOPSIS
/*	#include "bounce_service.h"
/*
/*	int     bounce_notify_service(queue_name, queue_id, encoding,
/*					sender, flush)
/*	char	*queue_name;
/*	char	*queue_id;
/*	char	*encoding;
/*	char	*sender;
/*	int	flush;
/* DESCRIPTION
/*	This module implements the server side of the bounce_notify()
/*	(send bounce message) request. If flush is zero, the logfile
/*	is not removed, and a warning is sent instead of a bounce.
/*
/*	When a message bounces, a full copy is sent to the originator,
/*	and an optional  copy of the diagnostics with message headers is
/*	sent to the postmaster.  The result is non-zero when the operation
/*	should be tried again.
/*
/*	When a bounce is sent, the sender address is the empty
/*	address.  When a bounce bounces, an optional double bounce
/*	with the entire undeliverable mail is sent to the postmaster,
/*	with as sender address the double bounce address.
/* DIAGNOSTICS
/*	Fatal error: error opening existing file. Warnings: corrupt
/*	message file. A corrupt message is saved to the "corrupt"
/*	queue for further inspection.
/* BUGS

/*	bounce(3) basic bounce service client interface
