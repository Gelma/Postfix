# NAME
#	relocated 5
# SUMMARY
#	format of Postfix relocated table
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/relocated\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The optional \fBrelocated\fR table provides the information that is
#	used in "user has moved to \fInew_location\fR" bounce messages.
#
#	Normally, the \fBrelocated\fR table is specified as a text file
#	that serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command.
#	The result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format,
#	is used for fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/relocated\fR in order to rebuild the indexed
#	file after changing the relocated table.
#
#	When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP
#	or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.
#
#	Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression
#	map where patterns are given as regular expressions. In that case,
#	the lookups are done in a slightly different way as described below.
#
#	Table lookups are case insensitive.
# TABLE FORMAT
# .ad
# .fi
#	The format of the table is as follows:
# .IP \(bu
#	An entry has one of the following form:
# .ti +5
#	\fIkey	new_location\fR
# .br
#	Where \fInew_location\fR specifies contact information such as
#	an email address, or perhaps a street address or telephone number.
# .IP \(bu
#	Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
#	are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
# .IP \(bu
#	A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
#	starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
# .PP
#	With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
#	tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the \fIkey\fR field is one of the
#	following:
# .IP \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR
#	Matches \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR. This form has precedence over all
#	other forms.
# .IP \fIuser\fR
#	Matches \fIuser\fR@\fIsite\fR when \fIsite\fR is $\fBmyorigin\fR,
#	when \fIsite\fR is listed in $\fBmydestination\fR, or when \fIsite\fR
#	is listed in $\fBinet_interfaces\fR.
# .IP @\fIdomain\fR
#	Matches every address in \fIdomain\fR. This form has the lowest
#	precedence.
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
# .fi
# .ad
#       When a mail address localpart contains the optional recipient delimiter
#       (e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR), the lookup order becomes:
#       \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser+foo\fR,
#	\fIuser\fR, and @\fIdomain\fR.
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
# .ad
# .fi
#	This section describes how the table lookups change when the table
#	is given in the form of regular expressions. For a description of
#	regular expression lookup table syntax, see \fBregexp_table\fR(5)
#	or \fBpcre_table\fR(5).
#
#	Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire
#	address being looked up. Thus, \fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not
#	broken up into their \fIuser\fR and \fI@domain\fR constituent parts,
#	nor is \fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.
#
#	Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
#	pattern is found that matches the search string.
#
#	Results are the same as with indexed file lookups, with
#	the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from the
#	pattern can be interpolated as \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR and so on.
# BUGS
#	The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
# .ad
# .fi
#	The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
#	this topic. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details
#	and for default values. Use the \fBpostfix reload\fR command after
#	a configuration change.
# .IP \fBrelocated_maps\fR
#	List of lookup tables for relocated users or sites.
# .PP
#	Other parameters of interest:
# .IP \fBinet_interfaces\fR
#	The network interface addresses that this system receives mail on.
# .IP \fBmydestination\fR
#	List of domains that this mail system considers local.
# .IP \fBmyorigin\fR
#	The domain that is appended to locally-posted mail.
