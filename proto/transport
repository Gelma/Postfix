# NAME
#	transport 5
# SUMMARY
#	format of Postfix transport table
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/transport\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The optional \fBtransport\fR table specifies a mapping from domain
#	hierarchies to message delivery transports and/or relay hosts. The
#	mapping is used by the \fBtrivial-rewrite\fR(8) daemon.
#
#	Normally, the \fBtransport\fR table is specified as a text file
#	that serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command.
#	The result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format, is used
#	for fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/transport\fR in order to rebuild the indexed
#	file after changing the transport table.
#
#	When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP
#	or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.
#
#	Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression
#	map where patterns are given as regular expressions. In that case,
#	the lookups are done in a slightly different way as described below.
# TABLE FORMAT
# .ad
# .fi
#	The format of the transport table is as follows:
# .IP "\fIpattern result\fR"
#	When \fIpattern\fR matches the domain, use the corresponding
#	\fIresult\fR.
# .IP "blank lines and comments"
#	Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
#	are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
# .IP "multi-line text"
#	A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
#	starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
# .PP
#	With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
#	tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are tried in the order as
#	listed below:
# .IP "\fIdomain transport\fR:\fInexthop\fR"
#	Mail for \fIdomain\fR is delivered through \fItransport\fR to
#	\fInexthop\fR.
# .IP "\fI.domain transport\fR:\fInexthop\fR"
#	Mail for any subdomain of \fIdomain\fR is delivered through
#	\fItransport\fR to \fInexthop\fR. This applies only when the
#	string \fBtransport_maps\fR is not listed in the
#	\fBparent_domain_matches_subdomains\fR configuration setting.
#	Otherwise, a domain name matches itself and its subdomains.
# .PP
#	Note: transport map entries take precedence over domains
#	specified in the \fBmydestination\fR parameter. If you use
#	the optional transport map, it may be safer to specify explicit
#	entries for all domains specified in \fBmydestination\fR,
#	for example:
#
# .ti +5
#	\fBhostname.my.domain	local:\fR
# .ti +5
#	\fBlocalhost.my.domain      local:\fR
#
#	The interpretation of the \fInexthop\fR field is transport
#	dependent. In the case of SMTP, specify \fIhost\fR:\fIservice\fR for a
#	non-default server port, and use [\fIhost\fR] or [\fIhost\fR]:\fIport\fR
#	in order to disable MX (mail exchanger) DNS lookups. The [] form
#	can also be used with IP addresses instead of hostnames.
# EXAMPLES
# .ad
# .fi
#	In order to send mail for \fBfoo.org\fR and its subdomains
#	via the \fBuucp\fR transport to the UUCP host named \fBfoo\fR:
#
# .ti +5
#	\fBfoo.org      uucp:foo\fR
# .ti +5
#	\fB\&.foo.org     uucp:foo\fR
#
#	When no \fInexthop\fR host name is specified, the destination domain
#	name is used instead. For example, the following directs mail for
#	\fIuser\fR@\fBfoo.org\fR via the \fBslow\fR transport to a mail
#	exchanger for \fBfoo.org\fR.  The \fBslow\fR transport could be
#	something that runs at most one delivery process at a time:
#
# .ti +5
#	\fBfoo.org      slow:\fR
#
#	When no \fItransport\fR is specified, the default transport is
#	used, as specified via the \fBdefault_transport\fR configuration
#	parameter. The following sends all mail for \fBfoo.org\fR and its
#	subdomains to host \fBgateway.foo.org\fR:
#
# .ti +5
#	\fBfoo.org      :[gateway.foo.org]\fR
# .ti +5
#	\fB\&.foo.org     :[gateway.foo.org]\fR
#
#	In the above example, the [] are used to suppress MX lookups.
#	The result would likely point to your local machine.
#
#	In the case of delivery via SMTP, one may specify
#	\fIhostname\fR:\fIservice\fR instead of just a host:
#
# .ti +5
#	\fBfoo.org      smtp:bar.org:2025\fR
#
#	This directs mail for \fIuser\fR@\fBfoo.org\fR to host \fBbar.org\fR
#	port \fB2025\fR. Instead of a numerical port a symbolic name may be
#	used. Specify [] around the hostname in order to disable MX lookups.
#
#	The error mailer can be used to bounce mail:
#
# .ti +5
#	\fB\&.foo.org      error:mail for *.foo.org is not deliverable\fR
#
#	This causes all mail for \fIuser\fR@\fIanything\fB.foo.org\fR
#	to be bounced.
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
# .ad
# .fi
#	This section describes how the table lookups change when the table
#	is given in the form of regular expressions. For a description of
#	regular expression lookup table syntax, see \fBregexp_table\fR(5)
#	or \fBpcre_table\fR(5).
#
#	Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire
#	domain being looked up. Thus, \fIsome.domain.hierarchy\fR is not
#	broken up into parent domains.
#
#	Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
#	pattern is found that matches the search string.
#
#	Results are the same as with indexed file lookups, with
#	the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from the
#	pattern can be interpolated as \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR and so on.
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
# .ad
# .fi
#	The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
#	this topic. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details
#	and for default values. Use the \fBpostfix reload\fR command after
#	a configuration change.
# .IP \fBparent_domain_matches_subdomains\fR
#	List of Postfix features that use \fIdomain.name\fR patterns
#	to match \fIsub.domain.name\fR (as opposed to
#	requiring \fI.domain.name\fR patterns).
# .IP \fBtransport_maps\fR
#	List of transport lookup tables.
# .PP
#	Other parameters of interest:
# .IP \fBdefault_transport\fR
#	The transport to use when no transport is explicitly specified.
# .IP \fBrelayhost\fR
#	The default host to send to when no transport table entry matches.
