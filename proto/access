# NAME
#	access 5
# SUMMARY
#	format of Postfix access table
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/access\fR
#
#       \fBpostmap -q "\fIstring\fB" /etc/postfix/access\fR
#
#       \fBpostmap -q - /etc/postfix/access <\fIinputfile\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The optional \fBaccess\fR table directs the Postfix SMTP server
#	to selectively reject or accept mail. Access can be allowed or
#	denied for specific host names, domain names, networks, host
#	network addresses or mail addresses.
#
#	Normally, the \fBaccess\fR table is specified as a text file
#	that serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command.
#	The result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format,
#	is used for fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/access\fR in order to rebuild the indexed
#	file after changing the access table.
#
#	When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP
#	or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.
#
#	Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression
#	map where patterns are given as regular expressions. In that case,
#	the lookups are done in a slightly different way as described below.
# TABLE FORMAT
# .ad
# .fi
#	The input format for the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command is as follows:
# .IP "\fIpattern action\fR"
#	When \fIpattern\fR matches a mail address, domain or host address,
#	perform the corresponding \fIaction\fR.
# .IP "blank lines and comments"
#	Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
#	are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
# .IP "multi-line text"
#	A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
#	starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
# EMAIL ADDRESS PATTERNS
# .ad
# .fi
#	With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
#	tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are tried in the order as
#	listed below:
# .IP \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR
#	Matches the specified mail address.
# .IP \fIdomain.tld\fR
#	Matches \fIdomain.tld\fR as the domain part of an email address.
# .sp
#	The pattern \fIdomain.tld\fR also matches subdomains, but only
#	when the string \fBsmtpd_access_maps\fR is listed in the Postfix
#	\fBparent_domain_matches_subdomains\fR configuration setting.
#	Otherwise, specify \fI.domain.tld\fR (note the initial dot) in
#	order to match subdomains.
# .IP \fIuser\fR@
#	Matches all mail addresses with the specified user part.
# .PP
#	Note: lookup of the null sender address is not possible with
#	some types of lookup table. By default, Postfix uses \fB<>\fR
#	as the lookup key for such addresses. The value is specified with
#	the \fBsmtpd_null_access_lookup_key\fR parameter in the Postfix 
#	\fBmain.cf\fR file.
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
# .fi
# .ad
#	When a mail address localpart contains the optional recipient delimiter
#	(e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR), the lookup order becomes:
#	\fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIdomain\fR,
#	\fIuser+foo\fR@, and \fIuser\fR@.
# HOST NAME/ADDRESS PATTERNS
# .ad
# .fi
#	With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
#	tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the following lookup patterns are
#	examined in the order as listed:
# .IP \fIdomain.tld\fR
#	Matches \fIdomain.tld\fR.
# .sp
#	The pattern \fIdomain.tld\fR also matches subdomains, but only
#	when the string \fBsmtpd_access_maps\fR is listed in the Postfix
#	\fBparent_domain_matches_subdomains\fR configuration setting.
#	Otherwise, specify \fI.domain.tld\fR (note the initial dot) in
#	order to match subdomains.
# .IP \fInet.work.addr.ess\fR
# .IP \fInet.work.addr\fR
# .IP \fInet.work\fR
# .IP \fInet\fR
#	Matches any host address in the specified network. A network
#	address is a sequence of one or more octets separated by ".".
#
#	Note: CIDR notation (network/netmask) is not supported with
#	lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
#	tables such as NIS,
#	LDAP or SQL.
# ACTIONS
# .ad
# .fi
# .IP "[\fB45\fR]\fINN text\fR"
#	Reject the address etc. that matches the pattern, and respond with
#	the numerical code and text.
# .IP \fBREJECT\fR
# .IP "\fBREJECT \fIoptional text...\fR
#	Reject the address etc. that matches the pattern. Reply with 
#	\fI$reject_code optional text...\fR when the optional text is 
#	specified, otherwise reply with a generic error response message.
# .IP \fBOK\fR
#	Accept the address etc. that matches the pattern.
# .IP \fIall-numerical\fR
#	An all-numerical result is treated as OK. This format is
#	generated by address-based relay authorization schemes.
# .IP \fBDUNNO\fR
#	Pretend that the lookup key was not found in this table. This
#	prevents Postfix from trying substrings of the lookup key
#	(such as a subdomain name, or a network address subnetwork).
# .IP \fBHOLD\fR
# .IP "\fBHOLD \fIoptional text...\fR"
#	Place the message on the \fBhold\fR queue, where it will sit
#	until someone either deletes it or releases it for delivery.
#	Log the optional text if specified, otherwise log a generic
#	message.
#
#	Mail that is placed on hold can be examined with the
#	\fBpostcat\fR(1) command, and can be destroyed or released with
#	the \fBpostsuper\fR(1) command.
# .sp
#	Note: this action currently affects all recipients of the message.
# .IP \fBDISCARD\fR
# .IP "\fBDISCARD \fIoptional text...\fR
#	Claim successful delivery and silently discard the message.
#	Log the optional text if specified, otherwise log a generic
#	message.
# .sp
#	Note: this action currently affects all recipients of the message.
# .IP "\fBFILTER \fItransport:destination\fR"
#	After the message is queued, send the entire message through
#       a content filter.  More information about content filters
#	is in the Postfix FILTER_README file.
# .sp
#	Note: this action overrides the \fBmain.cf content_filter\fR setting,
#	and currently affects all recipients of the message.
# .IP \fIrestriction...\fR
#	Apply the named UCE restriction(s) (\fBpermit\fR, \fBreject\fR,
#	\fBreject_unauth_destination\fR, and so on).
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
# .ad
# .fi
#	This section describes how the table lookups change when the table
#	is given in the form of regular expressions. For a description of
#	regular expression lookup table syntax, see \fBregexp_table\fR(5)
#	or \fBpcre_table\fR(5).
#
#	Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire
#	string being looked up. Depending on the application, that string
#	is an entire client hostname, an entire client IP address, or an
#	entire mail address. Thus, no parent domain or parent network search
#	is done, \fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not broken up into
#	their \fIuser@\fR and \fIdomain\fR constituent parts, nor is
#	\fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.
#
#	Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
#	pattern is found that matches the search string.
#
#	Actions are the same as with indexed file lookups, with
#	the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from the
#	pattern can be interpolated as \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR and so on.
# BUGS
#	The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
