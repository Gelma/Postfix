# NAME
#	virtual 5
# SUMMARY
#	format of Postfix virtual alias table
# SYNOPSIS
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/virtual\fR
#
#	\fBpostmap -q "\fIstring\fB" /etc/postfix/virtual\fR
#
#	\fBpostmap -q - /etc/postfix/virtual <\fIinputfile\fR
# DESCRIPTION
#	The optional \fBvirtual\fR alias table specifies address aliasing
#	for arbitrary local or non-local recipient addresses. Virtual aliasing
#	is recursive, and is done by the Postfix \fBcleanup\fR(8) daemon.
#
#	The main applications of virtual aliasing are:
# .IP \(bu
#	To redirect mail for one address to one or more addresses.
# .IP \(bu
#	To implement virtual alias domains where all addresses are aliased
#	to addresses in other domains.
# .sp
#	Virtual alias domains are not to be confused with the virtual mailbox
#	domains that are implemented with the Postfix \fBvirtual\fR(8) mail
#	delivery agent. With virtual mailbox domains, each recipient address
#	can have its own mailbox.
# .PP
#	Virtual aliasing is applied only to recipient
#	envelope addresses, and does not affect message headers.
#	Think Sendmail rule set \fBS0\fR, if you like. Use \fBcanonical\fR(5)
#	mapping to rewrite header and envelope addresses in general.
#
#	Normally, the \fBvirtual\fR alias table is specified as a text file
#	that serves as input to the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command.
#	The result, an indexed file in \fBdbm\fR or \fBdb\fR format,
#	is used for fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command
#	\fBpostmap /etc/postfix/virtual\fR in order to rebuild the indexed
#	file after changing the text file.
#
#	When the table is provided via other means such as NIS, LDAP
#	or SQL, the same lookups are done as for ordinary indexed files.
#
#	Alternatively, the table can be provided as a regular-expression
#	map where patterns are given as regular expressions. In that case,
#	the lookups are done in a slightly different way as described below.
# TABLE FORMAT
# .ad
# .fi
#	The input format for the \fBpostmap\fR(1) command is as follows:
# .IP "\fIpattern result\fR"
#	When \fIpattern\fR matches a mail address, replace it by the
#	corresponding \fIresult\fR.
# .IP "blank lines and comments"
#	Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored, as
#	are lines whose first non-whitespace character is a `#'.
# .IP "multi-line text"
#	A logical line starts with non-whitespace text. A line that
#	starts with whitespace continues a logical line.
# .PP
#	With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from networked
#	tables such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, patterns are tried in the order as
#	listed below:
# .IP "\fIuser\fR@\fIdomain address, address, ...\fR"
#	Mail for \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR is redirected to \fIaddress\fR.
#	This form has the highest precedence.
# .IP "\fIuser address, address, ...\fR"
#	Mail for \fIuser\fR@\fIsite\fR is redirected to \fIaddress\fR when
#	\fIsite\fR is equal to $\fBmyorigin\fR, when \fIsite\fR is listed in
#	$\fRmydestination\fR, or when it is listed in $\fIinet_interfaces\fR.
#	.sp
#	This functionality overlaps with functionality of the local
#	\fIaliases\fR(5) database. The difference is that \fBvirtual\fR
#	mapping can be applied to non-local addresses.
# .IP "@\fIdomain address, address, ...\fR"
#	Mail for any user in \fIdomain\fR is redirected to \fIaddress\fR.
#	This form has the lowest precedence.
# .PP
#	In all the above forms, when \fIaddress\fR has the form
#	@\fIotherdomain\fR, the result is the same user in \fIotherdomain\fR.
#	This works for the first address in the expansion only.
# ADDRESS EXTENSION
# .fi
# .ad
#	When a mail address localpart contains the optional recipient delimiter
#	(e.g., \fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR), the lookup order becomes:
#	\fIuser+foo\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser\fR@\fIdomain\fR, \fIuser+foo\fR,
#	\fIuser\fR, and @\fIdomain\fR.  An unmatched address extension
#	(\fI+foo\fR) is propagated to the result of table lookup.
# VIRTUAL ALIAS DOMAINS
# .ad
# .fi
#	Besides virtual aliases, the virtual alias table can also be used
#	to implement virtual alias domains. With a virtual alias domain, all
#	recipient addresses are aliased to addresses in other domains.
#
#	Virtual alias domains are not to be confused with the virtual mailbox
#	domains that are implemented with the Postfix \fBvirtual\fR(8) mail
#	delivery agent. With virtual mailbox domains, each recipient address
#	can have its own mailbox.
#
#	With a virtual alias domain, the virtual domain has its
#	own user name space. Local (i.e. non-virtual) usernames are not
#	visible in a virtual alias domain. In particular, local
#	\fBaliases\fR(5) and local mailing lists are not visible as
#	\fIlocalname@virtual-alias.domain\fR.
#
#	Support for a virtual alias domain looks like:
#
#	/etc/postfix/main.cf:
# .in +4
#	virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual
#
#	Note: some systems use \fBdbm\fR databases instead of \fBhash\fR.
#	See the output from \fBpostconf -m\fR for available database types.
#
# .ti -4
#	/etc/postfix/virtual:
# .nf
# .na
#	\fIvirtual-alias.domain	anything\fR (right-hand content does not matter)
#	\fIpostmaster@virtual-alias.domain	postmaster\fR
#	\fIuser1@virtual-alias.domain	address1\fR
#	\fIuser2@virtual-alias.domain	address2, address3\fR
# .fi
# .in -4
# .ad
# .fi
# .sp
#	The \fIvirtual-alias.domain anything\fR entry is required for a
#	virtual alias domain. \fBWithout this entry, mail is rejected
#	with "relay access denied", or bounces with 
#	"mail loops back to myself".\fR
#
#	Do not specify virtual alias domain names in the \fBmain.cf
#	mydestination\fR or \fBrelay_domains\fR configuration parameters.
#
#	With a virtual alias domain, the Postfix SMTP server
#	accepts mail for \fIknown-user@virtual-alias.domain\fR, and rejects
#	mail for \fIunknown-user\fR@\fIvirtual-alias.domain\fR as undeliverable.
#
#	Instead of specifying the virtual alias domain name via
#	the \fBvirtual_alias_maps\fR table, you may also specify it via
#	the \fBmain.cf virtual_alias_domains\fR configuration parameter.
#	This latter parameter uses the same syntax as the \fBmain.cf
#	mydestination\fR configuration parameter.
# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES
# .ad
# .fi
#	This section describes how the table lookups change when the table
#	is given in the form of regular expressions. For a description of
#	regular expression lookup table syntax, see \fBregexp_table\fR(5)
#	or \fBpcre_table\fR(5).
#
#	Each pattern is a regular expression that is applied to the entire
#	address being looked up. Thus, \fIuser@domain\fR mail addresses are not
#	broken up into their \fIuser\fR and \fI@domain\fR constituent parts,
#	nor is \fIuser+foo\fR broken up into \fIuser\fR and \fIfoo\fR.
#
#	Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the table, until a
#	pattern is found that matches the search string.
#
#	Results are the same as with indexed file lookups, with
#	the additional feature that parenthesized substrings from the
#	pattern can be interpolated as \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR and so on.
# BUGS
#	The table format does not understand quoting conventions.
# CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
# .ad
# .fi
#	The following \fBmain.cf\fR parameters are especially relevant to
#	this topic. See the Postfix \fBmain.cf\fR file for syntax details
#	and for default values. Use the \fBpostfix reload\fR command after
#	a configuration change.
# .IP \fBvirtual_alias_maps\fR
#	List of virtual aliasing tables.
# .IP \fBvirtual_alias_domains\fR
#	List of virtual alias domains. This uses the same syntax
#	as the \fBmydestination\fR parameter.
# .PP
#	Other parameters of interest:
# .IP \fBinet_interfaces\fR
#	The network interface addresses that this system receives mail on.
#	You need to stop and start Postfix when this parameter changes.
# .IP \fBmydestination\fR
#	List of domains that this mail system considers local.
# .IP \fBmyorigin\fR
#	The domain that is appended to any address that does not have a domain.
# .IP \fBowner_request_special\fR
#	Give special treatment to \fBowner-\fIxxx\fR and \fIxxx\fB-request\fR
#	addresses.
